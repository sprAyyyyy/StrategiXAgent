During the course of the treatment, the symptoms participants experience change, and whether the Apple watch can detect these changes. Ultimately, this knowledge is being used to design proactive tools and signatures that can predict complications or symptom changes before they happen.","Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, with a near-universal rate of recurrence, and reports low median survivals of between 14 and 18 months, even with maximal therapy. Although participants have frequent clinical and imaging follow-ups to monitor their condition, complications are difficult to anticipate and may arise suddenly. For instance, participants with glioblastoma commonly demonstrate hypercoagulability, predisposing them to venous thromboembolism (VTE) with significant morbidity and mortality. VTE is a leading cause of death among cancer participants receiving outpatient chemotherapy, and timely detection and treatment can increase survival. Wearable sensors, in the form of direct-to-consumer devices, may allow for insights to allow for timely, proactive interventions. Nearly 20 percent of US residents own a smart wearable device such as the FitBit or Apple watch. Integration of wearable devices into clinical care has accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic's boost in the development of telehealth services. The increasing accessibility and affordability of wearable technology have also allowed for new possibilities to deliver remote and timely care to participants.

The sensors in consumer devices capture a wide range of information. Trans-dermal optical photoplethysmography provides cardiac and respiratory measurements using non-invasive blood flow data. Meanwhile, motion and spatial data are supplied by accelerometers and gyroscopes. This raw data can then be assembled to provide insight into biometric parameters ranging from step counts to higher level information (e.g. VO2 max and sleep duration). Prior work has already used this data at a higher level to link movement activity and vital signs to a patient's thrombosis risk but has not been done in the brain tumor population. This study will ask participants to wear an Apple watch and document any health events or symptoms. Patterns will be analyzed within the captured data that may be associated with symptoms. By annotating symptomatic episodes, study is aimed to generate contextualized wearable sensor datasets that do not currently exist for glioblastoma participants and develop digital biomarkers for certain symptoms. For instance, abnormal variations in heart rate or breathing rate will be observed preceding a seizure or other transient neurological symptoms. Wearable data uses the patient's baseline at the beginning of the study as a matched control. Traditional follow-up care and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) evaluation rely on snapshot measurements, patient interviews, and clinician impressions during a relatively brief clinic visit. Wearable sensors may provide higher resolution information to help determine KPS between visit assessment and interventions. Some studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using wearables for remote monitoring of KPS in advanced gastrointestinal and lung cancers, but have yet to include participants with glioblastoma. One feasibility study has explored wearables in determining sleep quality in glioblastoma participants. To understand the relationship between actigraphy data and clinical scores of well-being in participants with glioblastoma, investigators will examine the association between collected movement data and KPS. This is a feasibility study using the Apple Watch and an iOS application on the participant's iPhone to collect continuous actigraphy data and annotate symptom occurrence. Apple's open-source framework is being utilized to specifically design for medical research, ResearchKit, to build the app and securely collect data.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06129760,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

We also want to find out if MBZ can slow the growth of the brain tumor. The study doctors have found that MBZ is effective against malignant brain tumors in the laboratory and animal models of brain tumors.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain cancer, and despite significant advances in treatment the majority of patients die within two years of diagnosis. During routine animal studies we serendipitously observed that fenbendazole, a benzimidazole antihelminthic used for pinworms, prevented tumor engraftment. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments with benzimidazoles identified mebendazole as the drug having the best results in preclinical testing 1. In GBM cell lines, mebendazole displayed cytotoxicity with IC50s ranging from 0.1-0.3 μM. Mebendazole disrupted microtubule formation in GBM cells and it's in vitro activity was correlated with reduced tubulin polymerization. In two orthotopic mouse glioma models, one syngeneic and one xenograft, mebendazole significantly extended average survival up to 63% compared to untreated controls 1.

Mebendazole is an FDA approved antiparasitic agent with a well-established side effect and safety record and was effective in our animal models in dosing schedules that are documented as safe in humans. Therefore, mebendazole is a possible anti-cancer therapeutic with pre-clinical safety and efficacy and provides a promising opportunity for a clinical trial in patients with malignant gliomas.

In addition, a recently published case report case report from the University of Michigan documented successful long term control in metastatic adrenocortical adenocarcinoma using mebendazole 2. Mebendazole was well tolerated at 200 mg/day and used as the sole treatment after the patient failed other chemotherapies.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01729260,chemotherapy,Adult,Metastatic,Unclear

There is an extreme need for any novel therapy against glioblastoma that increases progression free survival and overall survival in patients diagnosed with this invasive form of cancer. A significant reason for such a poor prognosis is the infiltrative nature of this tumor in non-enhancing regions (NE) beyond the central contrast-enhancing (CE) portion of tumor, which is difficult to visualize and treat with surgical, medical, or radiotherapeutic means.

Since tumor cells exhibit abnormal metabolic behavior leading to extracellular acidification, we theorize a newly developed pH-sensitive MRI technique called amine chemical exchange saturation transfer echoplanar imaging (CEST-EPI) may identify infiltrating NE tumor beyond what is clear on standard MRI with gadolinium contrast. This phase I safety study will use use intraoperative CEST-EPI guided resections in glioblastoma at increasing distances from areas of CE tumor to test whether this technique is safe and can remove additional areas of infiltrative NE tumor.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of pH-sensitive amine CEST-EPI guided resections for glioblastoma.The secondary objectives of this study include:

1. A preliminary efficacy analysis of CEST-EPI guided resections in extending progression free and overall survival.
2. To confirm that resected tissue obtained from pH-sensitive amine CEST-EPI guided resections contain infiltrating NE tumor.

The primary endpoint for this study will be safety of resecting ""CEST positive"", acidic regions within T2 hyperintense regions of glioblastoma thought to contain active NE tumor at increasing distances from contrast enhancing tumor with development of a recommended maximal tolerated resection.

1. At the maximal tolerated resection, a preliminary efficacy study with endpoints of progression free survival (as defined by RANO Resect 2.0) 1 and overall survival.
2. Quantitation of infilitrating tumor burden on CEST-EPI resected tissue using immunohistochemical staining.

Single-arm, surgical resection escalation safety trial with a preliminary efficacy study at the maximal tolerated resection

This safety evaluation will mimic a phase 1 dose escalation safety study using a rule based approach on based on a i3+3 design.2 Using standard of care resection of contrast enhancement as the baseline, we will begin with 3 subjects with maximal resection + ""CEST positive"" areas 0.7 cm from the contrast enhancing boundary within areas of T2 hyperintensity. If there is not \> 1 pre-determined resection limiting toxicity (RLT, defined below) in this cohort, the r","This is a single center, single arm, phase 1 surgical dose escalation clinical trial with a preliminary efficacy study at the recommended safe maximal resection. Total duration of subject participation will be two years. Total duration of the study is expected to be 5 years.

Patients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type (IDH-WT) glioblastoma will be enrolled in this study if within the selection criteria (see inclusion and exclusion criteria below). Prior to surgery, patients will undergo: 1) standard pre-operative medical clearance 2) standard of care pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 34 with gadolinium contrast with thin cut T1 with and without contrast and diffusion tensor imaging and 3) amine chemical exchange saturation transfer echoplanar (CEST-EPI) MRI. 3,18,19,33 Pre-operative post-processing of CEST-EPI regions to identify areas of potential infiltrating tumor will be carried out as previously described. 3 In addition, resection constraints will be added based (starting at 0.7cm and increasing in 0.7cm intervals over 4 intervals to a maximum constraint of 2.8cm). This maximum constraint will reach the theorized threshold for significant infiltrating tumor cell burden based on preliminary data. 3,14 This data will be converted into a intraoperative object through our intraoperative neuronavigation system (BrainLab Surgical Navigation System, Munich, Germany).

On day of surgery, subjects will undergo standard of care procedures for craniotomy for brain tumor resection at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Upon initial tumor resection, a biopsy specimen will be sent to neuro-pathology to confirm diagnosis. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a safe FDA approved fluorescence molecule used to increase extent of resection in glioma surgery will be administered for comparision with CEST imaging in surgery. 17 Areas of 5-ALA positivity and areas of CEST-EPI positivity will be biopsied for further comparision as described in the secondary objective. This will be followed by resection using the intraoperative CEST-EPI identified region with resection constraint using the intraoperative neuronavigation object. After completion of surgery, standard of care procedures for craniotomy will be completed.

To assess for short and long term complications related to surgery alone, patients will be admitted post-operatively with standard post-op care. There will be a immediate within 24-hr MRI while patient is inpatient, followed by 2 week post-operative visit alongside a 4 week MRI 35 to evaluate for rapid early progression. This will be followed with standard of care 8 week MRI and initiation of standard of care (temolozolomide and radiotherapy). The window of monitoring for surgery related complications will be the 4 week MRI and office visit as the resection limiting toxicities (described below) all fall within this window.

Given this protocol, safety constraints and analysis will follow a pre-determined statistical and methodological protocol. Using standard of care resection of contrast enhancement as the baseline, we will begin with 3 subjects with maximal CEST positive resection 0.7 cm from the contrast enhancing edge. The resection levels up to (0.7cm, 1.4 cm, 2.1cm or 2.8cm) from areas of CE tumor (""doses"") escalation within each cohort will occur following a rule-based approach based on a i3+3 design 2 with a target resection level limiting toxicity (RLT) probability of 0.25 and an equivalence interval (EI) of 0.20 to 0.30, meaning that the RLT rate must not exceed the upper bound of the equivalence interval (EI) in order to extend the distance from contrast enhancing edge or for a distance to be selected for validation/expansion in ""dose"" escalation (if already at the highest dose level). Given that variability in the data can be large in a small cohort, the i3+3 design requires 2 criteria are met when determining whether to stay at the current distance or to reduce. First, the RLT rate must exceed the upper bound of the EI (ie, ≥1 RLTs occur in 3 patients). Next, if subtracting 1 from the number of RLTs results in a RLT rate within the EI, then the i3+3 rules state to stay at the current level and enroll 3 additional patients (Note: if a cohort in Dose Escalation is expanded to 6 patients and the adjusted RLT rate remains within the EI, this dose may be further expanded/validated in dose expansion following discussion with the Independent Data Monitoring Committee \[IDMC\]/Safety Monitoring Committee \[SMC\]). However, if the adjusted RLT rate still exceeds the EI, the rules state to enroll 3 patients at the next lower level.

Decision Rule Table (source https://i3design.shinyapps.io/i3plus3/) :

Following the completion of resection level escalation, a recommended maximum resection (MR) will be calculated using all available RLT data. The recommended MR will be calculated using an isotonic regression. Under this framework, the MR is the resection for which the isotonic estimate of the RLT rate is closest to the target RLT rate of 0.25. The recommended MR or a lower recommended level will be selected as the primary recommendation or resection.

As a secondary objective, if the MR is greater than the standard of care resection, (the DSMB recommendation is that a certain interval of CEST-EPI resection is safe) the MR will be used for a single-arm preliminary efficacy analysis compared to propensity matched historical controls of resection of IDH-WT GBM. If this expansion is carried out, we will carry out CEST-EPI resections at the MR in 16 patients using the same protocol and follow up as described above. Follow up will additionally include interval MRI as recommended by RANO 2.0 1 to calculated PFS and OS. Comparisions with historical controls will be carried out with cox regression analyses.

As additional secondary data, an objective measure of tumor burden will be evaluated. Tumor tissue will be collected from each resection. The secondary endpoint of this study is to determine the dependence of pH-sensitive amine CEST-EPI contrast on ""active"" tumor density. This will be measured through immunohistochemical staning of tumor (via H\&E, anti-EGFR for EGFR amplified tumors), and proliferative tumor (anti-Ki67) which will be reviewed by blinded neuro-pathologist. Comaprisions of tumor burden across CEST-EPI and 5-ALA metrics will be compared with paired sample chi square tests and linear regression analysis. A study timeline is shown below.

Chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Temozolomide, may not work as well for the treatment of tumors that have the unmethylated MGMT. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

Simultanously it is the most agressive one of all primary brain tumors. Despite the treatment the outcome in that group of patients is poor. In case of the optimal therapy the estimated median of survival ranges between 12 and 16 months. The present standard of treatment embraces the gross total resection with the preserved neurological functions and the posoperative management according to the Stupp's protocol (fractionated radiotherapy of 60 Gy dose and the chemotherapy with Temozolamide).

Annually the incidence rate of GBM is 5/100.000 of population. According to the National Tumor Registry 2494 people went down to the malignant neoplasmatic disease of brain classified as C71 (ICD-10) in 2020. The evaluation indicates that it is 600 new patients with the diagnosis of GBM. The disease becomes the 9th cause of death among males and the 13th one among females. The peak of incidence appears in the 5th decade of life and concerns the most productive population. Routinely the management embraces the planning of the resection surgery based on the preoperative magnetic resonance investigation (MRI) with contrast. The common image of the tumor allows to put the preliminary diagnosis with the high probability rate. The GBM occurs as the enhanced tumor with the central necrosis and the circumferential brain edema visible in T2 and Flair sequences of MRI. Commonly the border of tumor becomes the line of contrast enhancement. The enhances area is the aim of surgical treatment. The lack of the preoperative enhanced area in the postoperative MRI is assumed as the gross total resection (GTR). It has been proved that the range of the resection translates into the overall survival (OS) and the progression free survival (PFS). Despite the resection classified as GTR the relapse in the operated area often occurs. It can be explained by the presence of the glioma stem cells in the surrounding neuronal tissue. They are responsible for the early relapse of GBM. Notably, it is evident that the MRI with contrast becomes the method which does not reveal the proper range of resection with the relevant sensitivity so as to extend PFS and OS. The positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the diagnostic methods having been clinically evaluated. PET assesses the metabolic demand of the neoplasm for the biochemical substrates. That methodology is commonly used in case of severity of the solid tumors. The fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) is the most frequently used. However the high metabolism of glucose within the brain, particularly in the grey matter, 18-FDG has the limitation in the process of planning of the tumor resection. The higher specificity and sensitivity are elicited among the markers including aminoacids, praticularly 11-C methionine (11C-MET). Within the gliomas the higher uptake is observed than in the healthy brain. The range of the contrast enhancement in the MRI covers only 58% of the higher 11C-MET metabolism. Comparing these results with a tumor resection beyond the enhancement area, indicates the necessity of the precise assessment of the proposed method in the routine planning of the glioma resection.

Current body of literature lacks in high quality research concerning that issue. The articles regarding the glioma resection beyond the GTR may be found instead. The surgery is limited to the resection of brain area with the incorrect signal in the FLAIR sequence, suspected of the presence of glioma stem cells. The described technique allows to extend PFS by for about 2 months. In that case the resection is based mainly on the FLAIR sequence which does not determine the presence of the neoplasm therein. The fusion of the MRI and the MET-PET images would allow to plan the resection so as to cover the area of incorrectly increased marker uptake.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06466031,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

A number of experimental antitumor approaches will be studied on PDOs. Results of these experiments will be correlated to the prognosis of patients.","Patient's Derived Organoids (PDOs) from tumour surgical biopsies are an innovative tool to test the response of individual patients to specific therapeutic strategies. Organoids are three dimensional (3D) structures made of organ-specific and self-organizing cells which can be maintained and propagated in culture. To date, PDOs have been established from a great number of cancer types, including prostate, ovarian and breast cancers. Glioblastoma PDOs have also been produced, and they were shown to maintain the characteristics of their parent tumours, both at mutational level and in terms of gene expression profiles and cellular heterogeneity. Since they recapitulate the characteristics of the original tumour better than GBM cell lines, they represent an important advancement for personalized medicine approaches. Thus, glioblastoma PDOs represent useful pre-clinical models for drug screening, CAR-T cell testing and for the generation of brain orthotopic xenografts in model models . In this perspective, the PDOs offer an opportunity to better characterize the molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma patients and to test new therapeutic strategies in a context that mimic parent tumour genetic properties.

Immunotherapy is emerging as a powerful anticancer approach in some cancer types. Immunotherapy exploits the ability of the immune system to recognise non self-antigens to target and destroy cancer cells. Immune checkpoints inhibitors (e.g. anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies) were shown effective in tumours exhibiting a high mutational burden, such as melanoma. Unfortunately, glioblastoma has a low mutational burden, resulting in a small amount of neoantigens. Moreover, glioblastoma is highly heterogeneous, meaning that not all the patients produce the same antigens. Thus, higher benefits could be achieved by developing immunotherapies that target multiple neoantigens and by combining neoantigen recognition strategies with immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors. In this perspective, epigenetic regulation to activate the transcription of normally silent transposable elements (TEs) in glioblastoma by DNA demethylating agents can enhance the production of neoantigens and trigger a specific immune response.

Transcription of TEs is low or absent in most adult cells, while it is more active during embryonic development, in stem cells and, intriguingly, in tumors. TEs de-repression in tumors occurs through multiple epigenetic changes to TE loci, including DNA demethylation and histone deacetylation. Both epigenetic changes can be associated with oncogenesis, resulting in different levels of epigenetic de-regulation. TEs overexpression in tumors compared with healthy tissue has prompted the search for anti-TE T cell responses in cancer. Proteogenomic approaches have identified tumor-specific, non-canonical open reading frames (ORFs) that encode peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I molecules on tumour cells. Most of the identified peptides derived from non-coding genomic regions. Interestingly some of these potential tumor-specific antigens are found in multiple patients and can induce immune responses in vitro or in mouse models. The investigators recently characterized a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in the antisense direction of SOD1 gene locus (SOD1-DT), that includes several transposable elements. Some of these (LTR and Alu) contain ORFs and could potentially encode different epitopes. By in silico translation of these elements, the investigators identified peptides corresponding to epitopes already tested as GBM-specific targets for cancer immunotherapies. However, the DNA sequence of these transposable elements is highly methylated in the nervous tissue and in the U87 GBM cell line (data from Genome Browser). The investigators will focus on the study of the TEs belonging to the LTR12C family, because they have been shown to act as enhancer-like and promoter-like elements, shaping the transcriptomics landscape in a tissue-specific manner. It has been already demonstrated that treatments with DNMTi and HDACi do not alter the expression of canonical genes but induce de novo transcription of LTRs, which in turn drive the expression of specific genes. In addition to producing the epitope, by activating specific LTRs, it is therefore possible to activate the genes connected to them. Notably, LTR12C was identified as regulator of proapoptotic genes, such as TP63 and TNFRSF10B. Thus, the proposed strategy could represent a generally applicable means to produce proapoptotic genes and immunogenic epitopes in a controlled manner, ensuring a very specific outcome.

Another potential source of neoepitopes is defective splicing. Splicing is a fundamental step in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) maturation operated by a large macromolecular machinery named the spliceosome. The spliceosome removes the introns and ligates the flanking exons of the pre-mRNAs, yielding the mature mRNAs. Regulated alternative splicing (AS) of many exons is exploited by cells to generate multiple protein isoforms from a single gene. However, the altered splicing program is often deregulated in cancer cells, generating an actionable vulnerability for tumours, including brain tumours. Profiling of primary and recurrent GBM and non-malignant brain tissues datasets has identified AS events that are differently regulated between in GBM and that could be translated into neoepitopes. These results suggest that splicing modulation could represent a valid therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma. Indeed, inhibition of the arginine methyl transferase PRMT5 in GBM cells dysregulates splicing and leads to incremented intron retention and cell senescence both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, PRMT5 has a role in the preservation of GSCs, which are necessary for tumour self-renewal. Recently, it was shown that pharmacologic inhibition of splicing generates splicing-derived immunogenic neoepitopes, which are presented by MHC-I on tumour cells and induce a T cell immune response in vivo. Another potential therapeutic target is the Splicing Factor 3b Subunit 1 (SF3B1), a core component of the splicing machinery that is overexpressed in GBM. Taken together, these results support the rationale of studying the effects of DNA demethylating agents and splicing inhibitors in glioblastoma PDOs and GSCs to identify suitable candidates to develop new therapeutic strategies for this disease.

The above-described approaches will be applied to prospectively enrolled patients undergoing neurosurgery for glioblastoma. Neurosphere cultures and PDO will be established from primary tumor tissue. Drug screening and cell manipulation to induce TE expression and to modulate splicing will be applied. The results of in vitro tests will be correlated with tumor molecular profile, response to treatments and overall patients outcome.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06781372,imaging; surgery; immunotherapy,Adult,Primary,Surgery

Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors. Some have certain changes (mutations) in the genes IDH1 or IDH2. If there are a high number of mutations in a tumor, it is called hypermutator phenotype (HMP). The drug nivolumab helps the immune system fight cancer. Researchers think it can be more effective in patients with IDH1 or IDH2 mutated gliomas with HMP. They will test gliomas with and without HMP.

Objectives:

To see if nivolumab stops tumor growth and prolongs the time that the tumor is controlled.

Eligibility:

Adults 18 years or older with IDH1 or IDH2 mutated gliomas

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history

Physical exam

Heart, blood, and pregnancy tests

Review of symptoms and activity levels

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants will lie in a cylinder that takes pictures in a strong magnetic field.

Tumor samples

Participants will get the study drug in 4-week cycles. They will get it through a small plastic tube in a vein (IV) on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-4. For cycles 5-16, they will get it just on day 1.

On days 1 and 15 of each cycle, participants will repeat some or all screening tests.

After cycle 16, participants will have 3 follow-up visits over 100 days. They will answer health questions, have physical and neurological exams, and have blood tests. They may have a brain MRI.

Participants whose disease did not get worse but who finished the study drug within 1 year of treatment may have imaging studies every 8 weeks for up to 1 year.

Participants will be called or emailed every 6 months with questions about their health.","BACKGROUND:

* Glioma is the most common malignant brain tumor. Genes coding for isocitrate dehydrogenases 1and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2), metabolic enzymes, are frequently mutated in gliomas, particularly lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). IDH1/2 mutation causes a unique tumor biology, including the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite, which in turn causes genomic hypermethylation and tumorigenesis.
* IDH-mutant LGGs undergo a slow but unremitting progression to higher grade transformation (HT) and eventually become high grade gliomas (HGGs) with a significant increase in the number of somatic mutations. A subset of patients with transformed HGGs develop a hypermutator phenotype (HMP), possibly related, but not limited, to previous treatment with alkylating agents and radiotherapy. The mechanisms of this clinical phenomenon are not fully understood, and no effective treatments are available for the HMP HGGs.
* High tumor mutation burden (TMB) is a characteristic finding in many of the transformed tumors. Furthermore, this increased mutation burden, with commensurate increase in neoantigen expression, may be correlated with a better response to immune checkpoint

inhibitor (ICPIs) treatment.

* Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD L1 and PD L2 and subsequently releasing PD 1 pathway mediated inhibition of the immune response, including antitumor immune response.
* The US Food and Drug Administration granted approval to nivolumab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin s lymphoma, recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high or mismatched repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.
* The first randomized clinical trial in glioblastoma with nivolumab (CheckMate-143) was completed in early 2017. Unfortunately, the study didn t meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival over bevacizumab monotherapy. The objective response rate (ORR) was lower in nivolumab arm than bevacizumab arm. However, the response with nivolumab was more durable. The safety profile of nivolumab was very consistent with what has been observed in other tumor types.

OBJECTIVE:\<TAB\>

-To determine the 6-month progression free survival rate in IDH-mutant gliomas patients with and without HMP in responses to nivolumab treatment.

ELIGIBILITY:

* Patients with diffuse glioma, confirmed by NCI Laboratory of Pathology
* Age greater than or equal to 18 years
* KPS greater than or equal to 60%
* IDH 1 or IDH 2 mutation confirmed by DNA sequencing
* Patients must have TMB status performed at NIH
* Tumor tissue or slides should be available for molecular and immune profiling

DESIGN:

* This study is an open label phase II clinical trial of the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, in patients with HMP and NHMP IDH-mutant gliomas.
* Patients with HMP and NHMP will receive nivolumab at a standard dose of 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks for cycles 1-2, then doses of 480 mg every 4 weeks for cycles 3-16. A maximum of 20 treatments will be given (16 cycles).
* A maximum of 29 patients with IDH-mutant glioma with HMP (Cohort 1) and 30 patients with NHMP (Cohort 2) will be evaluated.
* A Simon's optimal two-stage design will be used to conduct the HMP arm and the NHMP arm independently. For the HMP cohort, in stage I, a total number of 10 patients are accrued. If 9 or more patients progress by 6 months, the cohort will be terminated early; otherwise, additional 19 patients will be accrued in stage II, resulting in a total sample size of 29. Among these 29 patients, if 6 or more patients are progression-free at 6 months, we will claim that the treatment is promising for patients with HMP IDH-mutant gliomas. For NHMP cohort, in stage I, a total number of 15 patients are accrued. If 3 or more patients are progression-free at 6 months, the cohort will move to stage II and an additional 15 patients will be accrued in stage II, resulting in a total sample size of 30. Among these 30 patients, if 10 or more patients are progression-free at 6 months, we will claim that the treatment is promising for patients with NHMP IDH-mutant gliomas.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03718767,imaging; immunotherapy,Adult,Metastatic,Unclear

While a standard of care is established for the initial treatment of GBM - radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy - management of recurrent disease (NCCN, 2014) remains suboptimal. Treatment options include repeat surgery, re-irradiation, or chemotherapy (including experimental targeted therapies, biologic agents, and immunotherapies). Only a minority of patients has response to these treatments, and the resultant benefits in progression-free and overall survival are in the order of weeks to months.

Prognosis and response to therapy are known to be better in patients with a methylated MGMT promoter gene. Epigenetic silencing of MGMT by promoter methylation is an important factor in predicting outcome for patients with GBM treated with temozolomide. Approximately 66% of GBM tumors are MGMT unmethylated (high expression of MGMT), which through a MGMT repair mechanism, confers resistance to temozolomide, the standard chemotherapy treatment of GBM.

VAL-083, Dianhydrogalactitol (DAG), unlike temozolomide, is demonstrated to be active independent of MGMT resistance mechanisms, in vitro. Thus, it may provide a treatment option for those patients that are considered likely to be poor responders to temozolomide.

This is a non-comparative, two arm, biomarker-driven study with VAL-083 in GBM patients with either recurrent disease (Group 1) or newly diagnosed GBM patients requiring maintenance therapy after chemoradiation with temozolomide (Group 2).

Group 1: A total of up to 83 patients with recurrent/progressive GBM will be enrolled. This will include 35 patients treated at 40 mg/m2 and up to 48 patients treated at 30 mg/m2.

Group 2: Up to an additional 36 newly diagnosed GBM patients who have completed chemoradiation treatment with temozolomide and received no subsequent maintenance temozolomide will be enrolled.

Eligible patients will receive VAL-083 IV on days 1, 2, and 3, for up to 12, 21-day treatment cycles or until they fulfill one of the criteria for study discontinuation (disease progression, death, intolerable toxicities, investigator's judgment, or withdrawal of consent). Disease status will be evaluated with clinical and MRI evaluation every other 21-day cycle, while the patient is receiving VAL-083 treatment, and then approximately every 42 ± 7 days while remaining on study. Symptom burden will be evaluated using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) completed by patients at baseline and at the time of each imaging evaluation.

Interval medical histories, targeted physical exams, neurologic evaluations, complete blood counts, and other laboratory and safety assessments will be performed approximately every 21-days. Blood samples will be taken at Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose, 15 ± 5 min, 30 ± 5 min, 60 ± 10 min, 120 ± 10 min, 240 ± 15 min, and 360 ± 15 min after the end of the of iv infusion with VAL-083 to determine the PK profile and dose-exposure relationship of VAL-083.

Toxicity will be evaluated and documented using the NCI CTCAE version 4.

NCT06241391,Role of Ga-68 Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT in Detection of Recurrence in Patients With Gliomas,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,['NA'],INTERVENTIONAL,35,ESTIMATED,,2024-02,2025-02,2024-12,"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar",,Glioma; Astrocytoma; Anaplastic Astrocytoma; Oligodendroglioma; Glioblastoma Multiforme,PSMA PET-CT,18 years,,ALL,"As a part of molecular imaging, many PET tracers have been investigated in this regard. Those include 18F-FDG being glucose analogue, 18F-FLT representing nucleoside metabolism, and 18F-FDOPA, 18F-FET, 11C-MET as amino acids analogues. Among these, 18F-FDG is the most commonly used tracer due to its broader use and easy availability. However, high physiological uptake in the brain is a significant limitation. The main limitation of other tracers is the need for onsite cyclotrons for their production, making their availability difficult. So, the search for an ideal modality is still ongoing, and the latest addition to this search is a radio ligand labeled Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA). It is a new but potentially promising radiotracer, currently showing its utility in different malignancies. Investigators, therefore, aim to identify whether Ga-68 PSMA PET-CT has better diagnostic accuracy in the detection of recurrent gliomas than conventional imaging modalities.","Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA is a type II membrane glycoprotein and is typically overexpressed in primary and metastatic lesions of prostate malignancy as the name suggests. However, this overexpression is not limited to prostate cancer only. It has been reported that, PSMA is overtly expressed in the vascular endothelium of various other malignancies where significant neovascularization is seen. Gliomas being highly vascularized tumors, have shown significant PSMA expression in their vascular endothelium especially in high grade ones. If this PSMA expression can be assessed through noninvasive molecular imaging, this would further ease the management these tumors. Different lesions have shown different grades of PSMA uptake in the PET/CT with high grade gliomas showing high uptake. Most of the articles published till date are either case reports or studies comprising very few numbers of patients. We would like to use the PET tracer Ga -68 PSMA for the detection of recurrence in patients with glioma.

Investigators believe that 68 Ga PSMA PET-CT has the potential to play an imperative role in noninvasively evaluating recurrent gliomas and can overcome the limitations of the currently used modalities. Besides, extrapolation of the PSMA expression, which is indirect evidence of neovascularization, can also be used to assess treatment options like VEGF inhibitors (Bevacizumab). These studies can also pave the way for further studies involving PSMA-based radio ligand therapy, which is currently being successfully applied in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06241391,imaging,Adult,Metastatic,Unclear
NCT05577091,Phase 1 Study of Autologous Tris-CAR-T Cell Locoregional Immunotherapy for Recurrent Glioblastoma,RECRUITING,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,10,ESTIMATED,"Guanzhang Li, Dr.; You Zhai, Dr.",9/30/2023,11/1/2032,11/1/2024,Beijing Tiantan Hospital,"Beijing Neurosurgical Institute; Tasly Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd",Recurrent Glioblastoma,"Inverse correlated dual-target, truncated IL7Ra modified CAR -expressing autologous T-lymphocytes.",18 years,70 years,ALL,"This is a Phase 1 study of recurrent glioblastoma locoregional adoptive therapy with autologous peripheral blood T cells lentivirally transduced to express a dual-target, truncated IL7Ra modified chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), delivered by Ommaya reservoir, a pre-indwelled catheter in the tumor resection cavity or ventricle. Patients with pathological confirmation of glioblastoma and radiological evidence of recurrence are candidates for this clinical trial. If the patient meets all other eligibility criteria, and meets none of the exclusion criteria, will have leukapheresis, and a subsequent Ommaya reservoir implantation. T cells will be isolated from the PBMC sample and then be bioengineered into a 4th generation CAR-T cell, Tris-CAR-T cells.

Recipients will be assigned to three courses in the order of enrollment. The first 2 patients will be assigned to the low-dose group. The second 2 patients will be assigned to the high dose group. The first 4 patients will have at least one dose of autologous Tris-CAR-T cells delivery via the Ommaya reservoir, at a maximum of 6 doses. The interval between the first and the second dose is 28 days, and the rest doses will be administered weekly. The last 6 patients will be assigned to the consecutive multidose group, and will receive a weekly dose of autologous Tris-CAR-T cells for a maximum of 8 weeks. All patients will undergo studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR-T cells, physical examination, and cerebrospinal fluid cytokine assays to evaluate side effects. All patients will undergo a long-term follow-up.

The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of Tris-CAR-T cells can be manufactured to complete all the three courses. The other hypothesis is that Tris-CAR-T cells can safely and effectively be administered through the Ommaya reservoir to allow the CAR-T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled in the study. The primary aim of the study will be to evaluate the safety of Tris-CAR-T administration. Secondary aims of the study will include evaluating CAR-T cell distribution within cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood, tumor progress post-CAR-T cell infusion, and, if tissue samples from multiple time points are available, also evaluate the degree of target expression, biological characteristics of samples at diagnosis versus at recurrence or progression.","The autologous Tris-CAR-T cell, targeting both CD44 and CD133, the two inverse correlated targets, introduced truncated IL7Ra to the intracellular domain of the CAR molecule, and has shown ideal survival and tumor suppression in our previous studies. The cells will be tested for safety and kinetics in this clinical trial.

All patients are required to have an Ommaya reservoir in the tumor resection cavity before CAR-T cell infusion. Ommaya reservoir placement is done by surgery.

Autologous Tris-CAR-T cells will be manufactured via CliniMACS Instrument (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells will be thawed and sterily filled to infuse the patients. Each infusion will take between 5 and 10 minutes. We will then monitor the patient in the hospital for at least 3 days after the first dose of infusion. If the first infusion is tolerated well and the patient is assigned for multidose treatment, a second infusion may be given 28 days after the initial infusion for the first 4 patients (adverse effect assessment), and 7 days for the last 6 patients. Patients will be monitored in the hospital for no longer than 1 day. And the subsequent infusion will be done in the same manner. The treatment will be proceeded in the Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Patients who receive multidose treatment will need to stay in Beijing for up to 8 weeks from the first infusion so we can monitor for side effects and will be readmitted to the hospital if patient develops a fever. If patient develops severe fevers after discharge from the hospital, the patient will be readmitted to the hospital for close monitoring for at least one night for safety observation and adverse effects management.

The first 4 patients will have follow-up visits at weeks 2, 3, and 4, then at months 3, 6, and 9 post-infusion. Patients of the consecutive multidose group will have follow-up visits at week 2, then at months 1 and 3 post-infusion. All patients receive long-term twice a year for a total of 15 years.

Medical tests before treatment--

Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:

* Physical exam
* Blood routine, serum biochemical test, kidney and liver function
* Measurements of the tumor by routine MRI

Medical tests during and after treatment--

The patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and afterward:

* Physical exams
* Blood routine, serum biochemical test, kidney and liver function, serum and (or) cerebrospinal fluid analysis
* Measurements of the tumor by MRI. Cerebrospinal fluid may be drawn from the patient's existing Ommaya reservoir preferentially, or via lumbar puncture before each infusion and at each time of follow-up. This procedure can be done at the bedside under local anesthesia and about 1ml of cerebrospinal fluid will be removed. Additional cerebrospinal fluid may be removed when intracranial hypertension occurs or other clinical needs.

To learn more about the pharmacokinetics of autologous Tris-CAR-T cells, peripheral blood will be obtained simultaneously with the cerebrospinal fluid collection. The amount of blood taken will be based on clinical need, for approximately 5 mL each time.

If the tumor samples of the patients are obtained, we will request a sample to be used for research purposes.

The patient will receive supportive care for any acute or chronic cytotoxicity, including blood components, cytokine antagonists, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and other interventions as appropriate.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05577091,imaging; surgery,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

The drug mebendazole is an oral drug in a chewable 500 mg orange flavored tablet. It is already approved to treat parasitic infections. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and side effects for increasing doses of mebendazole, followed by the treatment of an additional 12 patients at the best tolerated dose.","The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral mebendazole in patients with recurrent/progressive pediatric brain tumors and to confirm the tolerance of the MTD of oral mebendazole by assessing tolerance in a dose expansion cohort. Secondary Objectives of the study include to determine the safety, tolerability and toxicity of mebendazole in this patient population, determine the plasma levels of mebendazole in this patient population and Determine progression-free and overall survival of mebendazole in an extended cohort of patients with treatment refractory pediatric brain cancer.

Mebendazole (MBZ) is a drug developed to treat human helminthic disease and is FDA-approved for the treatment of roundworm, common hookworm, American hookworm, pinworm and whipworm. MBZ use is well documented and frequently used in tropical countries at higher doses for the rarer parasitic infections of the brain.

We have shown efficacy in preclinical laboratory models of high grade glioma and medulloblastoma. Mebendazole therapy demonstrated safety in a phase I clinical trial for adults with high grade gliomas such as glioblastoma. This trial completed the maximum approved enrollment of 24 patients treated with mebendazole, with high doses consistent with dosing published for severe parasitic infections.

Laboratory studies indicate that mebendazole enters the brain and brain tumors at concentrations that may be effective for a combination of anti-cancer mechanisms. In animal models of brain cancer evidence suggest that mebendazole can prevent cell proliferation by interfering with tubulin formation, and it may prevent the formation of new abnormal blood vessels that feed tumor growth.

The patients for this experimental trial are those between the age of 1 to 21 with the diagnosis of medulloblastoma, or high grade glioma, where the tumor has resumed growth or continued to grow despite standard medical therapy. High grade glioma are those with a World Health Organization (WHO) grade of III or IV. It includes diagnosis of pediatric glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Patients who have failed other forms of experimental therapy may also be eligible for this trial.

Mebendazole is provided at no cost in the form of a chewable 500 mg tablets, recommended to be taken three times daily with meals or food. The pill can be chewed after meals, or ground up to be mixed with food or drink. It has a mild orange flavor that is similar in consistency to an antacid tablet.

Although side effects are rare and the vast majority are reversible, they include stomach upset, decreased blood count, and elevated liver enzymes due to inflammation.

The main additional procedure beyond taking this drug, is that patients are requested to consent to up to three additional blood draws to check the blood (serum) levels of the drug to ensure it is being absorbed at sufficient doses.

Patients can continue to receive the drug as long as in the attending physicians opinion the therapy is not causing any severe side effects, and there is no clear indication that the patient will not respond to mebendazole therapy. Patients can withdraw from this trial at any time for any reason, and may be eligible for other experimental therapies afterwards.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02644291,pediatric,Mixed,Unclear,Unclear

* Hyperactivating BRAF mutations or fusions predicted to be pathogenic by COSMIC
* NF1 loss

Each biomarker arm, within Phase 1, will have robust GO/ADAPT decision points, reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) to allow for both agility and clear direction for next steps. A 2-stage Bayesian adaptive design will be performed to assess preliminary efficacy.

In the Phase 1b of this study parallel biomarker defined arms will be opened, initially in the relapsed GMB setting, enrolling 12 patients onto each arm. These patients will be treated with avutometinib with a total weekly dose of 6.4mg, and defactinib with a total daily dose of 400mg.

Phase 2 efficacy testing will be undertaken in the front line adjuvant MRD setting. This can be either as double combination or in triple combination with temozolomide (concomitantly, or sequentially) depending on emerging data. Further details will be provided at once the SRC has assessed data from Phase 1 and formally opened Phase 2.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06630260,chemotherapy,Children,Unclear,Post-Surgery

* Trial with medicinal product","This is a randomized (2:1), explorative, parallel-group, open-label, phase II trial in elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In the control arm, patients will receive radiotherapy, in the experimental arm, patients will receive bevacizumab during and after radiotherapy until progression.

Background:

For decades, neurosurgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy have been the cornerstones of treatment for patients with glioblastoma. Most chemotherapeutic agents showed little or no activity in malignant glioma patients, with the possible exception of nitrosoureas. This has changed with the introduction of temozolomide, first shown to be active in recurrent disease (Yung et al. 2000) and more recently in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (Stupp et al. 2005, 2009). This EORTC 26981-22981 NCIC CE.3 trial demonstrated an increase in median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months and of the 2 year survival rate from 10% to 26% in patients receiving radiotherapy plus temozolomide compared with radiotherapy alone. Notably patients with tumors exhibiting methylation of the promoter region of the O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene showed a striking benefit from temozolomide (Hegi et al. 2005). Yet, inclusion in this trial was limited to patients up to the age of 70, and subgroup analyses demonstrated that younger patients were more likely to derive benefit from combined modality treatment than older patients. Thus, radiotherapy alone is still the standard of care in the elderly. The value of radiotherapy has been confirmed in a small randomized trial comparing best supportive care versus radiotherapy alone: median survival was 29 weeks with radiotherapy compared with 16.9 weeks with supportive care only (Keime-Guibert et al. 2007). Based on the overall shorter survival in elderly patients, hypofractionated radiotherapy has been explored and shown to be equieffective in patients aged 65-70 years and more (Roa et al. 2004). Two randomized trials presented in abstract form at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June 2010 failed to show superiority of primary temozolomide chemotherapy alone over radiotherapy alone in elderly patients (Malmstrom et al. 2010, Wick et al. 2010a). In fact, the German NOA-08 trial even showed that primary temozolomide alone is not non-inferior to primary radiotherapy alone (Wick et al. 2010a). A concomitant treatment strategy is currently evaluated in a NCIC-EORTC randomized trial. Further, the Nordic trial corroborated the equieffectiveness of an accelerated radiotherapy protocol of 40 Gy administered in 15 fractions versus the standard fractionation of 30 x 2 Gy. Altogether, these clinical data justify the exploration of new, temozolomide-free first-line treatment strategies in glioblastoma.

Glioblastomas express high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and are highly vascularized tumors. The VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, has recently gained approval in patients with recurrent glioblastoma in the USA and in Switzerland in 2009, but not in the EU. Its role in the first-line treatment of glioblastoma is currently being evaluated in randomized trials. There is limited data on the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in elderly patients with glioblastoma, although the safety profile of bevacizumab in elderly patients with other types of cancer, e.g., lung cancer is favorable. There are ample rationales for combining bevacizumab with radiotherapy, including the induction of VEGF by radiotherapy and the concept of vascular normalization resulting in increased oxygenation and thus sensitivity to radiotherapy. Thus, bevacizumab is not only expected to inhibit angiogenesis, but may also exhibit additive or synergistic interactions with radiotherapy and further impair tumor growth. Altogether, this study seeks to explore, using a dedicated neuroimaging protocol, the possibility that bevacizumab enhances the effects of radiotherapy via the process of vascular normalization.

The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the elderly.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01443676,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRIs, along with positron emission tomography (PET) and/or magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, may help doctors tell which changes are a reflection of the treatment and which changes may be due to progressing tumor.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. For each biomarker (dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR Imaging, fluciclovine F18 \[18F-fluciclovine\] PET, MR spectroscopy), to evaluate whether the biomarker can stratify patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) that have progressive enhancement within 12 weeks post-radiation therapy (XRT) into risk groups based on overall survival.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate whether each biomarker (dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR Imaging, 18F-fluciclovine PET, MR spectroscopy) can predict final determination of pseudo-progression (PsP) versus (vs.) true progression on follow-up MR imaging as evaluated by a semi-automated central reading process and by institutional radiologist readings.

II. To evaluate whether a prediction model that incorporates multiple biomarkers can discriminate patients with progressive enhancement within 12 weeks post-XRT into high and low risk groups for overall survival.

III. To evaluate whether clinical and imaging biomarkers are predictive of overall and progression-free survival in patients who do not show progressive enhancement within 12 weeks post-XRT.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine how different methods of defining PsP vs. true progression on imaging relate to patient survival.

Safety will be assessed at each dose level before proceeding to the next dose level. A special statistical technique called the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) will be used to determine when higher doses of virus can be administered. Other objectives of the study include characterization of the activity of C134 after inoculation into the tumor and of the local and systemic immune responses to C134. Patients will also be followed with MRI scans for potential clinical response to C134. The clinical strategy takes advantage of the virus' ability to infect and kill tumor cells while making new virus within the tumors cells; a critical enhancement of this effect is accomplished by the induction of an anti-tumor immune response; both effects are produced by the IRS-1 gene that was placed into the virus by genetic engineering. An additional important component of the research are systematic assessments of the quality of life on treated patients.","The efficacy of herpes simplex virus (HSV) as a treatment for brain tumors has been demonstrated experimentally. The earliest studies used an HSV that was genetically engineered so that the gene for an important enzyme, thymidine kinase (tk) was deleted. This engineered virus still killed tumor cells but was not toxic. Martuza and colleagues demonstrated that tumors implanted in mice shrank following treatment with varying doses of this virus.

Additional modified viruses based on the HSV backbone have been developed and tested with encouraging results.Viruses containing deletions in other important viral genes (e.g., DNA polymerase and the gene which can make the virus neurotoxic, γ134.5), also retained the capability of killing cultured human tumors but did not injure mice; in particular, they were safe for use in the brain. These viruses retained the viral tk gene, and so are susceptible to the antiviral drug acyclovir which is routinely used to treat HSV Infection, making them even more safe .

Martuza and colleagues generated G207, a modified HSV that contains (1) deletions of both copies of γ134.5 and (2) another gene called ribonucleotide reductase, was disabled secondary to disruption of the U139 gene by insertion of the E. coli LacZ coding region . G207 significantly prolonged survival of nude mice bearing human tumors. In addition, virus injected into the brains of the HSV sensitive primates (Aotus) did not produce any deleterious side effects.

G207 and 1716 have both been used in human trials. A dose-escalating phase 1 study of G207 was completed in patients with recurrent, progressive malignant glioma . The trial was conducted at University of Alabama at Birmingham and Georgetown University Medical Center. Twenty-one patients were enrolled in a total of seven dose-escalating cohorts, with three patients per cohort. Patients were stereotactically inoculated with G207 in the enhancing portions of their tumors. Five separate loci were inoculated in the final cohort; all previous cohorts were inoculated in a single locus within the enhancing tissue only. No toxicity definitively related to G207 was observed at doses up to 3 x 109 plaque forming units (pfu-these are active viral particles). In fact, a toxic dose level was not attained during this trial. This was due to viral processing techniques, limiting the total dose that could be administered.

In a Phase IB study, six patients with recurrent, resectable malignant glioma were enrolled at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in a trial examining a split dose administration strategy of G207. Patients underwent inoculation of G207 into their tumors, followed two to five days later by resection of the tumor and reinoculation of G207 into the tumor cavity. No dose limiting toxicities were seen in the trial, although one patient suffered a twelve hour period of mental status changes, weakness, and an elevated temperature when a protocol deviation resulted in an inadvertent partial dose of virus being administered intraventricularly, into the cerebrospinal fluid chamber of the brain. The patient fully recovered quickly and fully. One of the six patients went nearly two years before remote recurrence of her glioblastoma multiforme resulted in her death. A third study in 9 patients with recurrent malignant glioma was completed in which G207 was being administered followed by a single small dose of 5Gy of radiation. Nine patients were followed without any dose limiting toxicity, and some patients had remarkable responses to treatment. Currently, two clinical studies of oncolytic HSV are underway that examine G207 in pediatric patients as well as a novel oncolytic HSV expressing IL- 12, in adult patients. No findings of these two studies have yet been reported.

C134 was designed to replicate better than 1st gen HSVs. C134 is created by by inserting the PKR evasion gene, IRS1. from an evolutionary distant herpesvirus HCMV, which allows the virus to replicate much better but does not produce toxicity.

The described G207 trials clearly demonstrate that increased immune cell infiltrates within MG are associated with better outcomes. C134 elicits a robust immune response that contributes greatly to its antitumor effects.

C134 combines advantages of both wild-type and Δγ134.5 HSV and is an improvement over 1st generation viruses. C134 replicates and lyses tumor cells like a wild-type HSV in the IFN aberrant tumor environment, but is safe in normal cells. C134 induces immune responses which exceed those produced by 1st generation viruses. The study is designed to use all the information from any patients already treated to determine what the best dose for the next patient should be.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03657576,imaging; surgery; pediatric,Adult,Unclear,Unclear
NCT00089427,Phase I Study of Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) of IL13-PE38QQR Infusion After Resection Followed by Radiation Therapy With or Without Temozolomide in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Malignant Glioma,COMPLETED,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,24,,,2004-07,,2007-07,INSYS Therapeutics Inc,,Glioblastoma Multiforme; Anaplastic Astrocytoma; Oligoastrocytoma,IL13-PE38QQR; Surgery for placement; Radiation therapy; Temozolomide with radiation therapy,18 years,,ALL,"This Phase 1 study in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma is designed to determine the highest dose of IL13-PE38QQR that can be safely administered by Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) to the area around the tumor site after the tumor is surgically removed (resection). In addition, the patient will receive radiation therapy and may or may not be treated with oral temozolomide.","This is a Phase I clinical trial of experimental drug IL13-PE38QQR (Study Drug) in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. IL13-PE38QQR is a tumor-targeting agent administered by a continuous infusion directly into the brain around the cavity where the tumor has been removed. Through previous research, this Study Drug has shown potential to control some of the recurrent malignant gliomas, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma.

The Study Drug is made by combining a human protein (IL13) with a portion of a bacterial toxin protein, Pseudomonas Exotoxin (PE). The IL13 portion binds to receptors on the tumor like a ""key to a lock,"" allowing the PE portion to enter and kill those cells. Since tumor cells preferentially bind the drug, normal (healthy) brain cells are much less likely to be damaged by the drug.

The Study Drug is delivered through tubing or catheters placed directly into the area surrounding the resection cavity. These catheters will be surgically placed within 14 days after the tumor has been removed. A pump is then used to slowly push the drug solution through the catheters using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over a period of 4 days.

Following treatment with IL13-PE38QQR, all patients will receive standard courses of radiation therapy. In addition, some patients will receive adjuvant temozolomide with radiation therapy and continue with temozolomide after radiation therapy is completed.

Temozolomide is an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and sold for the treatment of recurrent GBM.

This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of IL13-PE38QQR when administered by CED after tumor resection and prior to radiation therapy with or without adjuvant temozolomide. Patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma who have had a gross total resection of their tumor and who meet all other specified eligibility criteria may be entered into the study.

Patients will be divided into 2 groups:

1. Stratum A - will receive treatment with IL13-PE38QQR followed by radiation therapy and
2. Stratum B - will receive treatment with IL13-PE38QQR followed by radiation therapy with adjuvant temozolomide. Treatment with temozolomide for Stratum B will continue after radiation therapy is completed.

Subgroups (cohorts) of patients will be treated with up to 3 doses of IL13-PE38QQR. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be treated at each dose level. Enrollment into each subsequent cohort will be dependent upon the safety and tolerability of treatment in the previous cohort.

All patients will need to have histopathological confirmation of malignant glioma diagnosis from tissue sample obtained at the time of gross total resection within 14 days of stereotactic catheter placement. Each patient will have 2-4 standard microinfusion catheters placed and infusion of IL13-PE38QQR will begin within 24 hours of catheter placement. The infusion will last for 96 hours. Approximately 2 weeks after completion of infusion, imaging for radiation therapy planning, a physical examination, and neurological and laboratory assessments will be performed. Patients, if stable, will then receive standard fractionated external beam radiation therapy with a total dose between 5940-6100 cGy using 180 to 200 cGy per fraction.

For those patients assigned to receive temozolomide in combination with radiation therapy, the dose of temozolomide will be administered on each day of radiation therapy and will be based on the patient's body surface area BSA at a dose of 75 mg/m²/day. After radiation therapy is completed and the follow-up MRI has revealed stable disease or a response, patients will continue temozolomide using repeat scheduled dosing at 150 -200 mg/m²/day for 5 consecutive days per 28 day cycle.

This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. The logistics and costs of navigating cancer treatments have become a principal contributor to patients' reduced quality of life. It is therefore important to reduce the burden of cancer in the lives of patients and their caregivers, and a vital aspect of this involves moving beyond traditional hospital and clinic-based care and evaluate innovative care delivery models with virtual capabilities.

Despite surgery and radiochemotherapy, the tumors are likely to grow back very quickly.

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) may improve local control rates while sparing healthy tissue (Giordano et al. 2014). IORT takes place before cranioplasty directly after gross (or subtotal) tumor resection. Several past studies on IORT for GBM conducted in Japan and Spain have yielded encouraging results (Sakai et al. 1989; Matsutani et al. 1994; Fujiwara et al. 1995; Ortiz de Urbina et al. 1995).

However, the full potential of the procedure is to date largely unexplored as most previous studies used forward-scattering (electron-based) irradiation techniques, which frequently led to inadequately covered target volumes. With the advent of the spherically irradiation devices such as the Intrabeam® system (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Oberkochen, Germany), even complex cavities can be adequately covered with irradiation during IORT. However, there is no data on the maximum tolerated dose of IORT with low-energy X-rays as generated by this system.

The INTRAGO I/II study aims to find out which dose of a single shot of radiation, delivered intraoperatively direct after surgery, is tolerable for patients with GBM.

Lifileucel (Amtagvi), the first FDA-approved TIL therapy, has shown remarkable efficacy in treating unresectable or metastatic melanoma. By extracting lymphocytes from the patient's tumor, expanding them ex vivo, and reinfusing them, Lifileucel has significantly improved the immune system's ability to combat cancer cells. This promising approach forms the basis for this study, which aims to apply similar methodologies to advanced or metastatic refractory lung cancer, a condition that generally has a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.

This trial involves several steps: initially, tumor samples are collected from patients for TIL extraction. Afterward, a lymphodepletion regimen using cyclophosphamide and fludarabine is administered to prepare the body for the infusion of expanded autologous TILs. Following the TIL infusion, Aldesleukin (IL-2) is administered to stimulate the TILs' activity. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), an immunotherapy targeting the PD-1 receptor on T cells, is also given to further enhance the immune response against the tumor.

The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.

To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.

We aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma.

Rationale: Current treatment management of patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is sub-optimal because of two main issues: (1) Creating an accurate target volume for radiotherapy, a key aspect of glioblastoma treatment, containing all remaining tumour cells after surgery that is impossible with the conventional CT and MRI imaging techniques currently used and (2) in the follow-up of patients after radiotherapy, conventional MRI is incapable of distinguishing tumour progression from treatment effects. The solution to these issues lies in accurate and non-invasive assessment of physiological processes of tumour cells to enable delineation of the true physiological clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy planning and to allow for early detection of true tumour progression during treatment follow-up.

Objective: Generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours.

Study design: By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, a physiological CTV will be generated for each patient in addition to the standard CTV. Treatment for each patient will be according to the current standard in which the standard CTV is used. Initial analysis will include comparing both CTVs in terms of volume and location. Patient follow-up will occur according to the clinical standard, including the standard MRI scan protocols, for a maximum of 2 years. Pattern-of-failure analysis will be done to compare the standard CTV and physiological CTV. It is hypothesized that the physiological CTV will be smaller than the standard CTV, whilst having the same pattern-of-failure.

Study population: 10 patients (\> 18 years), diagnosed with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as confirmed by molecular or immunohistochemistry analysis post resection/biopsy and referred to outpatient clinic of the department of Radiotherapy to undergo standard treatment with radiotherapy.

Intervention (if applicable): Each patient will have an extension to their standard, radiotherapy planning MRI scan taken for regular clinical care. This scan will last at maximum 60 minutes.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Equal prediction of pattern of failure (locations of tumour recurrence) based on the physiological CTV compared to the standard CTV used for radiotherapy planning, with the physiological CTV being smaller in volume.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The patients the burden of prolonged scan time (+ 30 minutes, scan will last 60 mins in total) during their standard RT planning scan. The remainder of their clinical care will not be altered: RT will be given to these patients based on standard CTVs. Follow-up will follow the clinical protocol .

Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) combines light and a photosensitizer. PDT has been used to treat a variety of cancers with varying degrees of success.

For the past thirty years Photolitec has been working to develop a treatment for glioblastoma or gliosarcoma using light and a photosensitizer. Photolitec's scientists were looking for a photosensitizer that:

1. has no significant systemic toxicity apart from some temporary skin photosensitivity,
2. crosses the blood brain barrier,
3. accumulates to a high level in glioblastoma and minimally in the brain,
4. is activated by the wavelength of light that penetrates most deeply into the brain,
5. minimizes any temporary skin photosensitivity.

This will make the brain tumor sensitive to light. Lighting up the brain using a low power near infrared laser will kill cells that contain Photobac®.

Photobac® crosses the blood brain barrier. Compared to the brain at 24 hours after injection, the tumor holds significantly more Photobac®. This Selective retention by tumors is the reason PDT has proved a valuable weapon against other types of tumors.

Once the surgeon has removed the tumor as completely as possible, the brain that bordered the tumor will be illuminated with near infrared light from a low power laser. This will destroy tumor cells hiding deep in the brain. Such cells cause tumor recurrence.

In more than 95% of cases, tumor recurrence is observed within 2 cm to 3 cm of the resection cavity within 4-7 months after initial treatments. One of the main causes of recurrence is the inability of chemotherapies to enter the brain from the systemic circulation due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is unique to cerebral blood vessels and blocks most drugs from entering the brain in sufficient concentrations.

Metformin is an oral inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I and is a widely used drug in diabetic and non-diabetic patients, safe and well tolerated in association with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Basing on drastic effect, the investigators have observed in vivo (reduction of \>50% of tumor growth) and hypothesize that metformin could be specifically efficient to treat up-front patients affected by OXPHOS+ GBM, in association with the standard first-line treatment with radiotherapy and temozolomide (RT-TMZ).

The investigators set up a dedicated molecular analysis including RNA assay and expression of OXPHOS markers for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors (FFPE), which allows to detect OXPHOS+ GBM at diagnosis.

Here a phase II, open label, non-randomized multicenter trial including five French neurooncology centers (H. Foch-Suresnes, Pitié-Salpêtrière-Paris, Saint Louis-Paris, Lyon, Marseille) and one in Italy (Istituto Besta, Milan) is proposed.

Newly diagnosed IDH wild-type GBM patients with the OXPHOS+ signature will be eligible for inclusion in this trial. The investigators expect to screen 640 patients and to include 64 patients over a period of 24 months with 24 months of follow-up.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04945148,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Unclear

Sulfasalazine is a potential tumor selective radiosensitizer.,"Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and most common type of primary brain cancer. Standard treatment at diagnosis is surgery followed by high dose radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Despite initial treatment nearly all patients will experience recurrence of the tumor with a dismal prognosis. There is no consensus on standard of care at recurrence. Reoperation is associated with a high risk of complications and further conventional radiation therapy is often not possible as the maximum tolerated dose to the normal brain has already been given. In addition most tumors have developed resistance towards chemotherapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be administered despite prior initial radiation treatment but in order to avoid radiation induced complications only limited doses to limited tumor volumes can be applied.

Developing new strategies to improve the effect of radiation selectively on tumor cells without simultaneously increase the radiation induced damage of normal brain would be valuable.

The investigators have shown in experimental studies that the drug sulfasalazine enhances the number of cancer cells that dies as result of radiation therapy and thereby improves survival in combination with SRS in animals with glioblastoma. Sulfasalazine inhibits the production of an antioxidant that normally protects the tumor against radiation. Hopefully the trial will result in a new and more effective treatment option for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04205357,chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

The study will have survival and toxicity endpoints. Patients will be treated with standard radiation therapy and daily temozolomide for 6 and a half weeks of radiation. Avastin will be administered every other week beginning a minimum of 28 days after the last major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury. Following completion of radiation therapy, patients will have a MRI and if there is no evidence of disease progression, patients will receive 12 cycles of Avastin, temozolomide, and topotecan (beginning a minimum of 14 days after the last radiation treatment).

Fifty (50) patients will initially be accrued to the study and the overall efficacy of the treatment regimen assessed. Analyses will be conducted within subgroups defined by methylation status.

Early side effects of radiation that may start during radiation include hair loss, scalp redness, inflammation of the ear canals, and fatigue. There is a small chance of long-term effects from radiation, occurring after months or years after completion. These may include worsening of mental function, hearing, vision, strength and coordination. In initial Phase I and II clinical trials, four potential Avastin-associated safety signals were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhage. Temozolomide has been well tolerated by both adults and children with the most common toxicity being mild myelosuppression. Other, less likely, potential toxicities include nausea and vomiting, constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning sensation of skin, esophagitis, pain, diarrhea, lethargy, and hepatotoxicity. With topotecan, reversible myelosuppression with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia is dose limiting. Nausea and vomiting, as well as diarrhea and alopecia, are frequent.

Diffuse infiltration of the brain by the tumor is thought to be one of the main causes of this therapy-resistance. In order to improve the surgical treatment, tumor regions with lower infiltration percentages need to be identified and resected during surgery, a so-called supramarginal resection. Currently, pre-operative T1 contrast enhanced weighted (T1c) MRI is used to identify the tumor for resection. We recently found the combination of apparent diffusion coefficient MRI and O-(2-\[ 18F\]fluoroethyl-)-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography (ADC/FET) to be significantly more accurate than T1c MRI alone in the detection of tumor infiltration. This makes ADC/FET a suitable candidate to guide supramarginal resection. Since FET PET is not as accessible and widely available as MRI, identification of an MRI based alternative could result in a more widespread implementation. Amide proton transfer chemical exchange saturation transfer (APT-CEST) MRI is a novel potential alternative for FET PET, since both measures are related to protein content.

Objective: In this project we aim to develop a safe and effective technique for ADC/FET guided resection of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and grade IV IDH-mutant astrocytoma. The safety concerns neurological deficits and time to start of adjuvant therapy, while the effectiveness is aimed at the extent of resection. Our secondary aim is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of APT-CEST MRI and to assess whether APT-CEST MRI can serve as an alternative for FET PET for the detection of tumor infiltration.

Study design: prospective observational intervention study

Study population: 30 patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of an untreated high grade glioma (suspected for glioblastoma (IDH wildtype) or grade IV astrocytoma (IDH mutant)), who are eligible for a supramarginal surgical resection and adjuvant treatment according two neurosurgeons in consensus and who are in relatively good condition (Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥70).

Intervention (if applicable): supramarginal ADC/FET-guided resection. To make sure that the standard treatment is always guaranteed, T1c MRI abnormalities will be included in the surgical target.

Main study parameters/endpoints: the main study endpoint is the optimization of ADC/FET-guided resection. Volumetric and percentual extent of resection, as measured with MRI and PET imaging, combined with surgery-induced morbidity will be used as outcome parameters. The secondary study parameters will be the histopathology-based diagnostic accuracy of APT-CEST MRI in comparison with FET PET, cognitive performance over time and progression free survival.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: participants will undergo pre- and postoperative MRI scanning. This is also part of regular clinical care, except there are additional MRI sequences including APT CEST in the pre-operative and pre-radiotherapy MRI. There are no risks associated with MRI acquisition after MRI safety screening. Participants will furthermore undergo a pre- and postoperative FET PET. The risks associated with PET scanning are limited, and the radiation burden will remain below 10 mSv (ICRP62 category intermediate risk (level IIb)). During surgery, biopsies are performed from areas that will be resected, so these biopsies will not introduce any extra risk. A potential benefit is the possibility of the removal of more tumor tissue. A potential risk is the additional removal of healthy brain tissue with the risk of neurological damage, which is controlled by pre- and intraoperative techniques such as visualization of white matter tracts and mapping (both asleep and awake) of critical functions such as language and control of strength.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06623565,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

The body's biological functions follow a circadian rhythm. Chronotherapy is the deliberate timing of medications to enhance therapeutic benefit and/or minimize toxicity, and can be achieved by dose-timing treatments. There is evidence suggesting that cancer cells may react differently to chemotherapy based on the time of day they are exposed. In fact, researchers have already found that giving anti-cancer treatments at a particular time of the day works better in rectal and ovarian cancer. TMZ is a standard of care treatment for GBM, however there is currently no consensus or guideline with respect to the optimal timing of adjuvant TMZ administration.

With emerging evidence that TMZ timing may be important, it is paramount to conduct a large pragmatic randomized study to assess this claim in GBM. The current study is a minimal risk pilot trial to inform the development of a larger, pragmatic randomized clinical trial in the future.

Prospective participants will be approached by their physician (or a member within the circle of care) during their routine clinic visit to begin the integrated verbal consent model process. The physician will explain that the patient is receiving standard of care treatment, with the only change being the timing of adjuvant TMZ (morning vs evening).

Overall prognosis remains poor for patients on standard of care therapies, with a 2-year survival rate of \< 20%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have the potential to meet this unmet medical need, however such therapies have yet to be fully explored in clinical trials powered for efficacy nor in the neoadjuvant setting. The interplay between the immune system and glioblastoma is complex and shaped by a variety of factors. Certain molecular factors that suggest a promising response to immunotherapies, in non-CNS tumors, paradoxically indicate a worse response in glioblastoma. Atezolizumab has shown several properties that make it an ideal candidate for further investigation in rGBM. Interestingly, a low tumor mutational burden has been implicated in T cell inflammation and immunotherapy outcome in rGBM patients treated with atezolizumab.

In this study, the investigators will determine whether neoadjuvant atezolizumab therapy provides a therapeutic benefit for patients with recurrent glioblastoma and a low mutational burden. Biological assessments of specimens collected in this trial will test the relationship between low TMB and features associated with immune-editing in rGBM.

(Dep. of Neurosurgery, Inselspital Bern)",5/1/2015,2025-12,2025-12,"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC,Glioblastoma,Surgery followed by adjuvant second-line therapy; Second-line therapy alone,18 years,,ALL,"Patients with glioblastoma face a grim prognosis. Despite recent advancement in neurosurgical technology and neuro-oncology glioblastomas almost invariably progress or recur after a median of 4-8 months. The strategy to repeat tumor resection at recurrence in order to minimize tumor load and thus to facilitate subsequent second-line therapy has been shown to be feasible and safe.

However, evidence for a survival benefit of surgery for recurrent glioblastoma is scarce and relies entirely on retrospective analyses. While most retrospective analyses report an apparent survival benefit, an EORTC meta-analysis on second-line therapies found no survival difference in patients with or without surgery at recurrence. With regard to the risks and costs inherent to surgery for glioblastoma, a randomized controlled trial is required.

The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of craniotomy and tumor resection followed by adjuvant second-line therapy to no surgery followed by second-line therapy on overall survival, neurological status, and quality of life. Analysis of overall survival will be used to improve sample size estimation of a subsequent phase III trial for craniotomy and tumor resection of glioblastoma recurrence in cooperation with the EORTC.","Background

Glioblastoma is a malignant, locally invasive brain tumor whose prognosis remains grim despite various intense treatment modalities. In the past, radical surgery was met with skepticism due to the aggressive infiltrative character of the tumor. However, an increasing number of retrospective studies over the last decade suggest a survival benefit for surgery. A recent post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial on the use of the surgical adjunct 5-ALA reported a prolonged overall survival from 11.9 to 16.7 months (evidence level 2a) after more extensive resection. Thus, maximal safe resection has become a mainstay of treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma, followed by adjuvant radio-chemotherapy.

Glioblastoma almost invariably recurs after a median of 6.9 months, leaving but few options for further treatment. Recurrence of glioblastoma after surgery and concomitant adjuvant therapy represents an additional therapeutic challenge and may be treated with second-line pharmacotherapy. In addition, a second surgery may also be considered in highly selected patients.

The rationale for surgery - maximum safe resection - is to prolong survival through reduction of tumor load, and, maybe due to an increased efficacy of adjuvant treatment. However, surgery carries risks of complications, that may result in a decreased functional and survival outcome. The crucial question therefore is whether, to what extent, and at what costs in terms of neurological risks a second resection prolongs survival.

Objective

The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare survival outcome after surgery followed by adjuvant second-line therapy to no surgery followed by second-line therapy in recurrent glioblastoma. An auxiliary objective to primary objective is to compare the survival outcomes of operated patients to control in the subgroups stratified by extent of resection: incomplete resection (non-CRET) vs complete resection (CRET).

Secondary objectives are: assessment of recruitment for all screened patients, comparison of progression-free survival between treatment arms, evaluation of crossover and comparison of patient quality of life between treatment arms.

Safety objectives are: to assess neurological deficits, local infections and morbidity associated to surgery and hospital stay after surgery and during follow-up.

Methods

All patients (≥18 years) with a radiological suspicion of first recurrence of glioblastoma are screened for this trial. Patients eligible for study participation are informed on the treatment options for recurrent glioblastoma (surgery followed by adjuvant second-line therapy, second-line therapy, or palliative therapy alone) by the center investigators. Patients randomized to the control group will receive second-line therapy according to local guidelines. Patients randomized to the interventional group will receive a craniotomy and resection of the tumor followed by adjuvant second-line therapy. Outcome will be measured at 3 months intervals.

...","Background

* Although the survival of gliomas has improved, most high grade gliomas will recur in field or adjacent to the treatment field within months to years of the original treatment. In newly diagnosed GBM, the concurrent use of radiation and temozolomide is standard of care.
* Surgical resection upon recurrence is possible in less than 50% of patients. For a significant proportion of recurrent glioma patients in whom reresection is not favourable and for whom systemic options have been exhausted, re-irradiation has emerged as a possible treatment option.
* Using modern precision RT techniques (stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), Rapid Arc techniques), re-irradiation has proven a feasible option with possible benefit in outcome as these techniques are often able to minimize dose to previously treated organs at risk in the field (OAR) and treat the recurrence safely.
* Data from multiple retrospective studies has indicated that not only is re-irradiation feasible, but it may actually improve survival in the appropriately selected patient.

Objective

The primary objective of this phase I study is to determine maximum tolerated re-irradiation dose (MTD).

Eligibility

* Recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma
* Prior standard radiation therapy to a dose ranging from 50 to 60 Gy at 1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction.
* Prior irradiation \> 12 months from enrollment on protocol.

Each MRI scan will take approximately 1 hour to complete. The first MRI scan will be performed once the patient is enrolled in the Novo-TTF treatment therapy, but prior to the initiation of Novo-TTF therapy. The second MRI scan will be performed up to 2-3 weeks after therapy had begun. The third MRI scan will be performed up to 2 months from the start of Novo-TTF treatment and the last MRI scan will be performed up to 4 months from the start of Novo-TTF treatment.

The MRI scans will be ordered by the principal investigator of the study and this will include standard MR imaging sequences along with advanced MR spectroscopy (MRS) to help identify response to Optune therapy. Please note: the only portion of the MRI scan that will be research-related are the MRS sequences. The other portion of the imaging will be considered as a standard of care MRI scan that will be reviewed by an attending physician, who will generate an MRI report in the electronic medical record system (EMS). The data collected from the advanced MRS sequences will be reviewed by the principal investigator and will be billed to the research study (you will be billed for the clinical MRI scan as a part of your standard of care).

The MRI study will be conducted at the Center for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy in the Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. The study scans will be very similar to routine clinical MRI scans of the brain.

The patient will be asked to lie on a specially designed bed and a circular antenna will be placed around the patients head. The patient will be given earplugs to wear to decrease the banging noise caused by the imaging process. The earplugs do not block out all sound since the MRI tech's wish to stay in communication with the patient at all times. The MRI techs will then move the patient into the magnet, a large hollow cylinder, until the patients head is at the center. The study will then proceed. The MRI operator will inform the patient of the progress of the study. The patient will need to keep perfectly still during the scanning.

During each MRI scan, the patient will have an intravenous line (IV line) placed. The IV line allows the contrast agent to be injected into the patient's vein. MRI contrast agents are chemicals that travel through the bloodstream. They act like dyes to make MRI pictures brighter and easier to read.

When the study is complete, the patient will be moved out of the magnet. The MRI operator will ask that the patient please get up slowly since the patient has been lying still for a relatively long period of time.

The investigators will also review the patient's medical records for information about medical history, current and past medications and therapies, and other information related to the patient's GBM.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02441322,imaging,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

If our hypothesis was supported by our study, we will be able to subselect patients based on initial imaging for more aggressive treatment.

Background information: Brain tumour affects approximately 2300 individuals per year in Canada. High grade glioma is the most common primary brain tumour in adults and accounts for approximately 2.5% of all cancer deaths. The real incidence of high grade glioma in the country is not known, but it affects approximately 2 per 100,000 people per year in Nova Scotia. Non-invasive, accurate and timely diagnosis is imperative.

High grade glioma is an aggressive neoplasm, and the median survival of affected patients is 12 months, irrespective of any form of treatment. The prognosis of these patients can only be determined on pathology after biopsy or surgery. Conventional imaging techniques such as as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) alone do not help in predicting the level of malignancy of cerebral gliomas. Formation of new blood vessels plays a central role in the growth and spread of tumours. The advanced imaging tool of computed tomography(CT) perfusion can be used to study blood supply to the tumor at the level of capillaries. This information permits determination of aggressiveness of cerebral gliomas at the time of diagnosis.

To direct better and aggressive care in patients with high grade cerebral glioma, it is important to identify patients whose life expectancy could be relatively longer. The two high grades of gliomas have been grouped together in the literature for both treatment and prognosis. There are only a few studies that have addressed the differentiation of the two higher grades of gliomas. Some of these are our own preliminary studies. In a preliminary study of 20 such patients,investigators have shown that CT perfusion can predict survival, irrespective of the pathological grade and treatement received. In the present study, investigators would like to extend our preliminary findings in a larger group of patients to ensure that this technique is indeed robust. In patients with shorter survival, the perfusion parameters may help in identifying new therapeutic targets (e.g., anti-angiogenic agents) that may help in the treatment of these patients.

Both CT and MR perfusion studies can be used to assess the blood supply of brain tumors. MR perfusion is limited in terms of absolute quantification of the perfusion parameters due to the non-linear relationship between the concentration of contrast material and the signal intensity change. MR perfusion studies also require two bolus injections of contrast agents. CT perfusion is a widely available and reliable technique which can give absolute quantification of perfusion parameters with a single acquisition and single bolus of a contrast agent.

Hypothesis- CT perfusion in high grade cerebral gliomas can predict survival irrespective of the pathological grade and irrespective of the treatment given.

Specific objectives: Conduct a prospective study in a larger cohort of patients with high grade cerebral gliomas to assess the utility of CT perfusion and compare this with demographic factors, tumour grade and treatment for estimating prognosis.

Research design: This prospective cohort study will be done over a period of 2 years at QE II Health Sciences Centre, Infirmary Site. All patients, presenting with a newly detected brain lesion likely to be high grade cerebral glioma either on CT or MRI of the brain, will be asked to participate in this study. Pregnant patients or those with impaired renal function will be excluded from the study. Informed consent will be obtained.

Approximately 100 new patients with cerebral glioma present to our brain tumour clinic every year. Our intent is to recruit at least 50 patients with high grade cerebral glioma each year for 2 consecutive years. Each patient will undergo a single CT perfusion scan before undergoing any biopsy or surgical resection.

CT perfusion technique- The CT perfusion scan will be performed on a 128 slice multi-detector CT scanner (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens). CT perfusion imaging will be performed at the time of routine preoperative neuronavigation imaging. A non-contrast CT head scan will be acquired to localize the tumour before obtaining a perfusion scan. Four 5 mm thick slices with matrix size of 512x512 will be selected at the level of the tumour. Multiple images will be acquired at each levels starting 5 sec after the injection of 50 cc of non-ionic iodinated contrast media (Omnipaque 300) at a rate of 4 cc/sec. The acquisition parameters will be 80 kVp and 100 mA. The images will be acquired every second for a total of 110 sec. The images will be sent to a separate post-processing work station and the post- processing will be performed using the CT perfusion software (Siemens). Two CT perfusion parameters (cerebral blood volume and permeability surface area product) will be calculated using multiple regions of interest in the areas of tumour showing the highest perfusion values. Another region of interest will be placed in the contralateral normal looking white matter.

The patient will undergo biopsy or surgery and histopathological examination of the tissue as per standard of care in our hospital. The perfusion parameters will be correlated with the grade of glioma on pathology. The patient will receive adjuvant treatment as per the institutional standard of care and will be followed clinically as per standard of care. The perfusion parameters will be then correlated with the survival of these patients.

Data analysis- Perfusion parameters will be compared between glioma and normal brain tissue and between different grades of gliomas using a Student 2-sample test. A Cox regression analysis with proportional hazards will be used to determine the relationship between overall survival and perfusion parameters. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be drawn to demonstrate the relationship between perfusion parameters and overall survival in patients. A p value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

Expectations and Relevance of the proposed research

* CT perfusion will help in preoperative characterization of high grade cerebral gliomas and their level of aggressiveness.
* Perfusion parameters will help in predicting the prognosis(irrespective of grade of tumour and treatment given) of the patients with high grade cerebral glioma. This may help in targeting aggressive therapy to patients with predicted longer survival.
* In patients with predicted shorter survival, the perfusion parameters may direct future research on new therapeutic targets.

Possible pitfalls and possible solutions:

1. Radiation exposure from CT perfusion- These patients undergo radiotherapy as part of their treatment, which will have significantly higher radiation dose compared to CT perfusion. Radiation dose from CT perfusion is equivalent to that of 2 head CT scans.
2. Potential kidney toxicity of iodinated dye- Only 50 cc of CT dye will be used, which is smaller compared to the regular dose for enhanced CT scan. Patients with compromised renal function will be excluded from our study.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01923922,imaging; surgery,Children,Unclear,Post-Surgery

In the absence of hematological toxicity \> grade 1 during the first cycle the dose of lomustine can be escalated to 110 mg/m² (cap 200 mg) in their second cycle.
* Arm 2 (control arm): Lomustine single agent 110 mg/m² every 6 weeks (cap. 200 mg) (at further progression treatment will be according to investigators discretion).

One cycle will be defined arbitrarily (due to the lomustine sequencing) as 6 weeks for all arms. Day 1 of a cycle will be the first day when medication is taken.

Previously collected blood and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for MGMT methylation status, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, and biomarkers of the VEGF pathway.

Patients and their caregivers/relatives complete quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC-BN20) at baseline, at 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after completion of study therapy.

NCT02490930,A Safety Study of Fingolimod With Radiation and Temozolomide in Newly Diagnosed High Grade Glioma,COMPLETED,['EARLY_PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,5,ACTUAL,"Stuart Grossman, MD (Johns Hopkins University)",2015-07,2017-09,2017-09,Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins,,Glioblastoma; Anaplastic Astrocytoma,Fingolimod,18 years,,ALL,"A recent prospective multicenter study by Dr. Grossman demonstrated that 40% of patients with high grade glioma undergoing radiation and chemotherapy developed severe and persistent lymphopenia (CD4 counts \<200 cells/mm3). This lymphopenia lasted for twelve months following radiation treatment and on multivariate analysis was associated with shorter survival. Our group has data that strongly suggests that this lymphopenia is secondary to the inadvertent radiation of circulating lymphocytes as they pass through the radiation beam. Investigators propose the use of FDA approved for multiple sclerosis, fingolimod to signal lymphocytes to leave the circulation prior to the initiation of radiation. It is a functional antagonist of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) pathway and prevents lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs.

Oral fingolimod will be given 1 week prior to the initiation of concurrent radiation and temozolomide and will be discontinued immediately upon completion of the six weeks of therapy. The primary objective is to evaluate if fingolimod can be safely combined with radiation and temozolomide. Secondary endpoint is total lymphocyte counts (TLC) for the proposed study participants. Investigators expect that patients receiving radiation and temozolomide plus fingolimod have a recovery of lymphocyte counts to 80% of baseline within four months, reference to historical control in which sustained lymphopenia lasted for twelve months.","Five evaluable patients with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas who will undergo standard concomitant radiation and temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide will be accrued to this open-label, single arm, safety study. Oral fingolimod will be given 1 week prior to the initiation of concurrent radiation and temozolomide and will be discontinued immediately upon completion of the six weeks of therapy.

The primary objective is to evaluate if fingolimod can be safely combined with radiation and temozolomide. This standard chemoradiation causes 40% of patients to develop severe lymphopenia two months after initiation of therapy. Investigators expect that when this is combined with fingolimod, virtually all patients will have severe lymphopenia two months after beginning treatment. Investigators will determine if these patients who routinely receive pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis develop other severe opportunistic infections that would prohibit further evaluation of this novel treatment approach. Primary endpoint is incidence of greater than or equal to Grade III infections attributable to fingolimod-induced lymphopenia defined by the NIH/NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) within four months of starting fingolimod.

The secondary objective is to obtain preliminary information regarding the ability of fingolimod to reduce radiation-related lymphopenia three months after stopping fingolimod. The NIH funded Adult Brain Tumor Consortium (ABTC) followed total lymphocyte and CD4 counts in 96 patients after treatment with radiation and temozolomide. The severe lymphopenia (CD4 count less than 200/mm3) lasted for twelve months in this historical control. Secondary endpoint is total lymphocyte counts (TLC) for the proposed study participants. These will be compared with patient level data on TLC from an historical cohort obtained from the ABTC. Investigators expect that patients receiving radiation and temozolomide plus fingolimod have a recovery of lymphocyte counts to 80% of baseline within four months, reference to historical control in which sustained lymphopenia lasted for twelve months.

Investigators will also obtain laboratory analysis on lymphocyte subtypes and cytokine levels (CD3, CD4, CD8, IL-7, TGF-Beta, etc.).

The study will have two phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2a. Phase 1 is a standard cohort dose escalation 3+3 design used to determine the maximum tolerated dose for Phase 2a. There will be up to 24 patients enrolled in Phase 1. There will be 25 patients enrolled in Phase 2a. For both phases of the study, NEO100 will be self-administered four times daily for a 28-day treatment cycles until disease progression, death or patient withdraw from study for any reason, whichever occurs first.

Version 10 of the protocol changed the inclusion criteria for Phase 2a to limit inclusion to those patients with progressive or recurrent primary or secondary Grade IV gliomas expressing IDH1 mutations. Prior to the protocol amendment, 4 patients were enrolled who were IDH1 wild-type. Therefore, an additional 28 patients will be recruited for a total of 32 patients enrolled into Phase 2a of this study to have 35 evaluable cases.

Version 12 of the protocol expanded the inclusion criteria for Phase 2a to include those patients with progressive or recurrent Grade III Astrocytoma expressing IDH1 mutations.

Review of the literature specific to these patients found the same expected time to progression and death. As a result, the number of patients to enroll remains 32 to have 35 evaluable cases.","Malignant glioma, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO grade IV astrocytic glioma) accounts for over half of all gliomas, which in turn account for 80% of all malignant brain and CNS tumors. In European and North American countries, the incidence rate is approximately four to five new cases per 100,000 people per year.

Most patients with glioblastoma are faced with a dismal prognosis. Advances in neurosurgery, radiation, and chemotherapy during the past decade have provided only small improvements in clinical outcome, with a 5-year survival rate remaining at less than 10%.The first-line treatment of GBM is usually surgery, both to confirm the diagnosis and to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Concurrent temozolomide with radiotherapy followed by adjuvant systemic temozolomide has produced a median survival of 14.6 to 16.6 months, and this regimen is now the standard of care for GBM, as well as grade III anaplastic glioma.

Regardless of the treatment regimen, the aggressive infiltration of glioblastoma throughout the brain typically produces progressive disability, ultimately leading to death in nearly all cases. Innovative treatment is urgently needed.

Molecular profiling is being used to separate patients with GBM into prognostic groups. A mutation affecting codon 132 of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene was found to occur in up to 12% of glioblastomas. A review of sequencing studies on large glioma patient cohorts have found IDH1 mutations present in 6% (range 3-16%).

IDH1 mutation is considered a definitive diagnostic molecular marker of glioblastomas and is considered more reliable and objective than clinical criteria. Long term outcome for patients with high-grade glioma including glioblastoma directly correlates to IDH1 mutation status. IDH1 mutated tumors have been associated with an improved outcome comparable to IDH1 wild-type tumors. IDH1 mutation has remained an independent favorable prognostic marker even after adjustment for age, grade, MGMT status, genomic profile and treatment in multivariate analysis. Median OS for glioblastoma patients following first recurrence is 9.8 months for IDH1 wildtype tumors versus 19.32 months for IDH1 mutated cancers. No increase in PFS was found.

Anaplastic astrocytoma is a rare, malignant brain tumor that arises from a subtype of glial cells that make up the majority of cells in the central nervous system, called astrocytes. Approximately 70-80% of WHO Grades II and III astrocytoma possess IDH mutations. In general, those diagnosed with initial grade III astrocytomas have a higher survival rate than patients with grade IV astrocytomas (5-year survival rate, Grade III, 71 participants, 49.2 ± 6.6 months vs. Grade IV, 216 patients, 9.6 ± 4.4 months). Interestingly, the presence of IDH mutations predict a favorable disease outcome with prolonged median survival in grade IV astrocytoma (IDH wild type: 15 months; IDH mutant: 31 months) and grade III anaplastic astrocytoma (IDH wild type: 20 months; IDH mutant: 65 months).

The reported median overall survival (OS) for glioblastomas is 14-15 months. Patients with initial diagnosis grade III astrocytoma have a considerably higher OS (45.2 ± 5.2 months with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, compared to 31.9 ± 2.7 months with no treatment), and progression free survival (PFS) (42.8 months treated with adjuvant temozolomide, compared to 19.0 months for people not treated with adjuvant temozolomide).

Patients with recurrent Grade III astrocytoma have effectively the same OS to grade IV tumors. A study carried out in 2018 showed 23 out of 100 patients experienced reoccurrence within an average time of 37 months after initial treatment and had an average OS after recurrence of 12.7 months. Additional research confirmed both that a high percentage of anaplastic astrocytomas reoccur and those that do occur have a median OS of approximately 10 months. Finally, 357 patients with highly anaplastic tumours were investigated between 1977 and 1989 (prior to the change in classification of brain tumors by the WHO). A total of 81 of these patients experienced tumour reoccurrence and required secondary treatment. The median OS for these patients was 53 weeks (13.2) months from the start of the secondary treatment. Based upon these studies, it is believed patients with IDH1 mutated recurrent or progressive Grade IV glioblastoma and IDH1 mutated recurrent or progressive Grade III astrocytoma have the same clinical prognosis with respect to progression free survival and overall survival and suitable for study in this protocol.

One reason for the poor prognosis of malignant glioma and astrocytoma patients is the difficulty of penetrating the blood brain barrier (BBB) with chemotherapy agents. Nasal brain delivery of chemotherapy offers a novel, paradigm shifting platform based on technology to deliver chemotherapy via inhalation to the brain tumor. The presumed mechanism of nasal brain delivery from preclinical rodent studies is thought to be via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Effective nasal brain delivery has been demonstrated in humans in other diseases. For example, Reger et al. have reported effective delivery of intranasal insulin for Alzheimer's disease.

NEO100 has been demonstrated to open the BBB in a reversible and nontoxic fashion in vitro and in vivo, enabling greatly increased brain entry of all tested therapeutics and was well tolerated in animals. Mechanistic studies revealed effects of NEO100 on different BBB transport pathways. An in vitro BBB, consisting of human astrocytes and brain endothelial cells, has been used to determine trastuzumab penetration when administered with NEO100, greatly increasing trastuzumab penetration. In vivo, IA NEO100-mediated BBB opening resulted in tumor-selective accumulation of trastuzumab , without detectable presence in normal brain tissue, along with increased presence of immune cell populations. IV delivery of trastuzumab or T-DM1 achieved significantly greater overall survival of tumor-bearing mice when combined with IA NEO100.

In a case lesson, after surgical removal of her recurrent GBM tumor, a patient received daily intranasal NEO100 therapy for more than 3 years before a second recurrence emerged. At that time, a final dose of NEO100 was given shortly before the tumor tissue was surgically removed, and the tissue was processed for high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of perillyl alcohol and its primary metabolite, perillic acid. Both molecules could readily be detected in the tumor tissue. This is the first demonstration of perillyl alcohol and perillic acid in brain tumor tissue from any patient. It reveals that intranasal administration of NEO100 is a valid approach to achieve delivery of this agent to a brain tumor. In view of the non-invasive and safe nature of this method, along with tentative indications of activity, these findings add confidence to the notion that intranasal administration of NEO100 holds potential as a new treatment option for brain-localized malignancies.

Perillyl alcohol, also called p-metha1,7-diene-6-ol,or 4-isopropenylcyclo-hexenecarbinol, is a monoterpene, isolated from the essential oils of lavender, peppermint, spearmint, and several other plants and synthesized by the mevalonate pathway. It has been previously demonstrated to have anti-cancer properties in preclinical studies in rodent models for a variety of cancers including mammary, pancreatic, and colon cancer. Although the exact mechanism of perillyl alcohol induced tumor regression is unknown, perillyl alcohol has been reported to modulate cellular processes that control cell growth and differentiation including G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis.

Perillyl alcohol has also been shown to inhibit post-translational modification of proteins involved in signal transduction. It has been postulated that the anti-neoplastic activity of perillyl alcohol involves a decrease in the levels of isoprenylated Ras and Ras-related proteins, thereby reducing the physiological functioning of these proteins. Protein isoprenylation involves the post-translational modification of a protein by the covalent attachment of a lipophilic farnesyl isoprenoid group to a cysteine residue at or near the carboxyl terminus. Isoprenoid substrates for prenylprotein transferase enzymes include farnesyl pyrophosphate plus geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, two intermediates in the mevalonate pathway. This action was attributed to the inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase activity. Farnesylation is the most critical part of the process that leads to the activation of Ras, and farnesyl transferase inhibitors exert their antitumor effect in part by inhibiting Ras-mediated signaling. A study revealed that H-Ras and K-Ras farnesylation were inhibited by perillyl alcohol.

Ras activity is elevated in malignant glioma tumors. Activated Ras stimulates other pathways essential for proliferation and progression through the cell cycle and inhibition of apoptosis in malignant gliomas. Moreover, the formation of malignant gliomas requires the cooperation of both Ras and Akt signaling. This cooperative effect has been demonstrated by somatic-cell gene transfer, during which transfer of either an activated form of K-Ras or Akt alone to neural progenitors was insufficient to form malignant glioma in vivo, but the combined effect of both pathways could initiate gliomagenesis. Thus, based on this known alteration in signal transduction involving K-Ras in malignant glioma, and its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, perillyl alcohol (NEO100) may be an attractive agent and warrants further clinical development.

Furthermore, intranasal delivery of NEO100 has the additional, potential benefit of direct drug delivery into the brain and avoiding systemic toxicity and first pass metabolism. It is believed the mechanism of action of NEO100 is similar in both patients with progressive or recurrent Grade IV gliomas who have IDH1 mutations and patients with progressive or recurrent Grade III astrocytomas who have IDH1 mutations making inclusion of both populations appropriate for this study.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02704858,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

Two critical questions remain- the role of bevacizumab maintenance and bevacizumab at the time of progression in a patient previously treated with bevacizumab at the time of initial diagnosis.","Given the possible synergism with irinotecan and bevacizumab for colorectal carcinomas, the combination has been studied in gliomas. In a study of 21 patients, the combination of irinotecan and bevacizumab produced a 43% response rate, with acceptable toxicity. The response rate is significantly higher than irinotecan alone and any other therapy for recurrent glioma. There were two serious adverse events, one intracranial hemorrhage and one bowel perforation. At the Duke Brain Tumor Center, the investigators have treated over 1000 glioblastoma patients with a bevacizumab-containing regimen, and there is marked clinical benefit and acceptable toxicity. Our initial study looking at the combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan for patients with recurrent glioblastoma published in 2007 found impressive response rates and survival and corroborated the earlier experience of Starks-Vance.

The investigators completed a study for newly diagnosed glioblastoma that utilized bevacizumab, radiation therapy and temozolomide followed by 6 months of bevacizumab, irinotecan and temozolomide. In addition, the group at University of California at Los Angeles published a study with bevacizumab, radiation therapy and temozolomide followed by 12 months of bevacizumab and temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. These two phase II studies reported acceptable toxicity and a suggestion of improved survival compared to historical controls, and led to two large phase III randomized, placebo controlled studies of the addition of bevacizumab for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. The current proposal builds on the encouraging results of the addition of bevacizumab to the standard therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. Two critical questions remain- the role of bevacizumab maintenance and bevacizumab at the time of progression in a patient previously treated with bevacizumab at the time of initial diagnosis.

Despite well-conducted treatments including surgery, chemo-radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC) protocol, recurrences remain unavoidable within approximately 6 months and the overall survival rate of patients at 5 years is inferior to 10%.

In case of recurrence, a second surgery, radiotherapy under stereotaxic conditions, bevacizumab or other innovative techniques have been proposed. However, they are not yet considered as reference treatments, due to the absence of therapeutic trials definitively proving their efficacy.

Evaluation of GBM progression is based on MRI, corticosteroid intake and clinical status.However, positron emission tomography (PET) is an extremely relevant examination for differentiating between true progression and pseudo-progression. Indeed, an increase in the transfer of amino acids in 18 F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA)-PET strongly suggests a recurrence. A local treatment can then be proposed by favoring surgery or, as an option, radiotherapy under stereotactic conditions. However, this treatment, even if it is well tolerated, has an efficacy which could be improved.

Often proposed option to improve efficacy of this radiation technic consists in increasing the dose of irradiation. This dose increase is often limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissue. It could however be possible with coupled techniques of intensity modulation and stereotaxy within the framework of an integrated boost (Simultaneous Integrated Boost - SIB). At each radiation session, the dose delivered to the tumor volume would be increased in the metabolic volume (BTV) detected by FDOPA-PET.

The objective of this study is to evaluate, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma, the efficacy of a dose increase using an SIB in a volume delineated with FDOPA-PET.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05653635,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Recent scientific research has shown that Metformin, a common drug used to treat diabetes mellitus, may improve the results of the treatment in patients with a variety of cancers, such as breast, colon, and prostate cancer.

In addition, Metformin lowers blood glucose levels, and subsequently reduces the insulin and Insulin-Growth-factors which are growth-promoting factors with a direct impact on GBM cellular proliferation and invasion.

Metformin may improve the outcomes of patients with GBM when added to current treatment consisting of maximal safe surgical resection followed by neo-adjuvant TMZ and concomitant accelerated hypofractionated limited-margin XRT followed by adjuvant TMZ. Our Neuro-Oncology group at McGill University reviewed the results of an ongoing Phase II study in patients with GBM. A group of 33 patients were treated according to protocol, and with a median follow-up of 11 months, the median survival was 17.5 months which compares favourably to current results from standard treatment with a beneficial 2-week shortening of the XRT treatment time.

This is a phase II clinical trial to assess the feasibility and overall toxicity of adding Metformin to Neoadjuvant Temozolomide followed by concomitant Temozolomide and accelerated hypofractionated limited-margin radiotherapy and followed by adjuvant Temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

It is expected that the proposed study treatment will improve the median survival from current values of 20 months (current MUHC Neo-adjuvant Phase 2 data) to 25 months. This means an improved outcome of 25%. Using one-tailed statistics, and with a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05, the sample size for this Phase II trial will be 50 patients.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02780024,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have malignant glioma.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CCI-779 in patients with malignant glioma.
* Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of survival and objective response, in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients in phase II are stratified according to use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no) and disease type (glioblastoma multiforme with stable neuro-imaging after radiotherapy vs recurrent malignant glioma). Patients in phase I must be currently receiving EIAEDs.

* Phase I: Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes once weekly. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CCI-779 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

* Phase II: Patients receive CCI-779 as in Phase I. Patients who are candidates for surgical resection of recurrent disease receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes 2 hours prior to surgery and then once weekly, as above, once recovered from surgery.

Patients are followed for survival.

Patients will be recruited to the study by the principal investigator (PI) or one of the co-investigators (CI) at one institution, Hackensack University Medical Center. Accrual is expected to continue for 18 months.

The protocol has a planned enrollment of 10 patients. Should patients discontinue treatment on protocol for reasons unrelated to toxicity (e.g. lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent), additional patient (s) may be enrolled to complete enrollment.

Following maximal debulking surgery, patients will undergo a gadolinium enhanced brain MRI within 72 hours and a screening visit 2 to 4 weeks following surgery. Extent of resection will be recorded as biopsy, partial resection or gross-total resection based upon residual enhancing tumor on post-operative MRI.The day prior to XRT start, patients will have a clinic visit for training and application of the NovoTTF-200A device. During this visit, the patient will be educated regarding general use and maintenance of the device, with a particular focus upon strategies to prevent, identify and manage dermatologic adverse events (dAE). Temozolomide will be dosed nightly during XRT as per standard of care, and NovoTTF-200A will be worn continuously, removed during XRT and replaced as soon as possible thereafter.

During XRT and for 12 weeks to follow, the patient will have study visits at regular intervals (TAB A) for a physical examination and to assess toxicity and device compliance. Visits outlined in TAB A are in addition to weekly visits during radiotherapy with the treating radiation oncologist. MRI will be obtained at 4 weeks (+/-7 days) and 12 weeks (+/-7 days) following completion of XRT, and maintenance temozolomide will recommence in 5/28 day cycles as per standard of care. Objective response will be assessed as defined by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria (TAB C) by the treating physician and confirmed by a second investigator.

In the case of suspected pseudoprogression, continued treatment and subsequent evaluations will help clarify whether it is true progression. Patients may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. If subsequent evaluations suggest that the tumor has in fact progressed, the date of progression will reflex to the date when the issue was first raised. However, if subsequent evaluations demonstrate improvement without change in therapy, the initial tumor increase may be considered pseudoprogression and response may be recorded as not evaluable for that time point. In the case of clinical progression, an unscheduled MRI will be obtained within 1 week of the investigator becoming aware of the clinical progression. No additional MRIs will be required after progression.

Temozolomide and NovoTTF-200A will continue until the final study visit, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Thereafter, temozolomide, MRI and response assessments will continue as per standard of care. Following the final study visit, the patient will be followed at a minimum of every two months for survival, either by phone or in person. If the patient is free of unacceptable toxicity attributable to NovoTTF-200A, they will be offered the opportunity to continue the device at no financial cost, but without obligation to do so.

Unacceptable toxicity includes the occurrence of device related serious adverse events or clinical and functional deterioration considered by the investigator to be prohibitive of continuing treatment. Treatment with the NovoTTF-200A device does not need to be terminated in the case of temozolomide toxicity.

The primary endpoint will be safety and tolerability of combined modality treatment with radiotherapy, temozolomide and NovoTTF-200A, based upon the incidence and severity of adverse events. Secondary endpoints will be overall survival, progression free survival and quality of life.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03232424,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

The study will be divided into two stages: a Phase I dose escalation stage and a Phase II expansion stage.","Phase I dose escalation stage.

During the Phase I escalation stage, patients with selected advanced solid tumors will be divided into three groups: the Lurbinectedin Escalation Group, the Irinotecan Escalation Group and the Intermediate Escalation Group. Each group will have a different dose escalation scheme. A treatment cycle is defined as an interval of three weeks.

Three to six patients will be included at each dose level. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in less than one third of evaluable patients in each cohort, escalation can proceed to the next dose level within each group.

The MTD in each group will be the lowest dose level explored during dose escalation in which one third or more of evaluable patients develops a DLT in Cycle 1. At any dose level, if one among the first three evaluable patients has a DLT, the dose level should be expanded up to six patients. Dose escalation will be terminated once the MTD or the last dose level is reached, whichever occurs first, except if all DLTs occurring at a given dose level are related to neutropenia (i.e., febrile neutropenia, grade 4 neutropenia lasting \> 3 days or neutropenic sepsis) in which case dose escalation may be resumed, starting at the same dose level and following the same original schedule but with mandatory primary G-CSF prophylaxis.

Once the MTD has been reached, a minimum of nine evaluable patients will be recruited at the immediately lower dose level (or at the last dose level if the MTD is not defined yet): this level will be confirmed as the RD if less than one third of the first nine evaluable patients develop DLT during Cycle 1.

Phase II expansion stage.

If signs of activity are observed in one or more tumor types, there will be a phase II expansion stage after the RD is defined for each group. A tumor-specific expansion cohort (or cohorts if signs of activity are observed in more than one of the permitted tumor types) at each of these RDs may include approximately 20 treated patients per tumor type. If no indication of efficacy is observed in the dose escalation phase of a specific group, then recruitment of patients into that group may be terminated.

Furthermore, one new cohort of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), with approximately 40 treated patients, will be included in the Phase II expansion stage of this study. Patients in this cohort will be treated at the RD determined during the Phase I escalation stage in the Lurbinectedin Escalation Group (Lurbinectedin 2.0 mg/m2 plus irinotecan 75 mg/m2 with the administration of G-CSF). These patients will be divided into two groups of 20 treated patients each:

* Group 1 will include patients with poorly differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine cancer (NEC) (Ki67 \>20%) of gastroenteropancreatic origin or unknown primary site (excluding lung primary tumors) according to the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the digestive system, after progression to first-line chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen.
* Group 2 will include patients with well differentiated grade 2 (Ki-67 3-20%) or grade 3 (Ki-67 21-55%) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) according to the 2019 WHO classification of tumors of the digestive system, after progression to no more than three prior lines of systemic therapy.

Following the finding of promising efficacy to date, two expansion cohorts in the Lurbinectedin Escalation Group will be further expanded:

* The cohort of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) will be expanded to at least 100 patients treated in second line.
* The cohort of patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) will be expanded with between 25 and 80 treated patients with synovial sarcoma (a subtype of STS)

Only in these two expansion cohorts, an Independent Review Committee (IRC) will determine the response evaluation at each tumor assessment necessary to derive the best patient's response and assign the date of first documentation of response and progression/censoring according to RECIST v.1.1.

The central clinical hypothesis for the GCC2020 study is that combining ibrutinib (BTK-inhibitor) with indoximod (IDO-inhibitor) during chemotherapy will synergistically enhance anti-tumor immune responses, leading to improvement in clinical response with manageable overlapping toxicity.

GCC2020 is a prospective open-label phase 1 trial to determine the best safe dose of ibrutinib to use in combination with a previously studied chemo-immunotherapy regimen, comprised of the IDO-inhibitor indoximod plus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and etoposide (4-drug combination) for participants, age 6 to 25 years, with relapsed or refractory primary brain cancer. Those previously treated with indoximod plus temozolomide may be eligible, including prior treatment via the phase 2 indoximod study (GCC1949, NCT04049669), the now closed phase 1 study (NLG2105, NCT02502708), or any expanded access (compassionate use) protocols.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with gliomas that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying the patient's white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) vIII incorporated in the retrovirus.

Objective:

The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-EGFRvIII cells) are a safe and effective treatment for advanced gliomas.

Eligibility:

- Adults age 18-70 with malignant glioma expressing the EGFRvIII molecule.

Design:

Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed

Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-EGFRvIII cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}

Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-EGFRvIII cells, and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans every month for the first year, and then every 1-2 months as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.","BACKGROUND:

- Patients with recurrent gliomas have very limited treatment options. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

(EGFRvIII) is the most common mutant variant of EGFR and is present in 24-67% of patients with glioblastoma.

* EGFRvIII expression promotes oncogenesis and is associated with poor prognosis.
* EGFRvIII is not expressed in normal tissue and is an attractive target for immunotherapy.
* We have constructed a retroviral vector that contains a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes the EGFRvIII tumor antigen, which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this CAR with high efficiency without the need to perform any selection.

NCT01180816,Phase I Trial of Super-Selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion of Temozolomide (Temodar) for Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme and Anaplastic Astrocytoma,COMPLETED,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,21,ACTUAL,,2010-08,8/11/2020,2017-12,Northwell Health,Feinstein Institute for Medical Research; Hofstra North Shore,Glioblastoma Multiforme; Anaplastic Astrocytoma,Super-Selective Intraarterial Intracranial Infusion of Temozolomide,18 years,,ALL,"The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA. Initial therapy has consisted of surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. More recently, a Phase 3 clinical published by Stupp et al in 2005 showed a benefit for using radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant Temozolomide. Still, all patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Superselective Intra-arterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) is a technique that can effectively increase the concentration of drug delivered to the brain while sparing the body of systemic side effects. One currently used drug called Temozolomide (Temodar) has been shown to be active in human brain tumors but its actual central nervous system (CNS) penetration is unknown. This phase I clinical research trial will test the hypothesis that following the standard 42 day Temozolomide/radiotherapy regimen, Temozolomide can be safely used by direct intracranial superselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion (SIACI) up to a dose of 250mg/m2, followed by the standard maintenance cycle of temozolomide to ultimately enhance survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM/AA. The investigators will determine the toxicity profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SIACI Temozolomide. The investigators expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of SIACI Temozolomide therapy for malignant gliomas, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near future.","The current standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM is radiation therapy plus concomitant oral Temozolomide of doses of 75mg/m2 up to 150mg/m2. Because of the blood brain barrier (BBB) where drugs do not penetrate the blood vessel walls well to get into the brain, no one knows for sure if these oral drugs actually get into the brain after infusion. Previous studies have shown that intra-carotid artery (intra-arterial) delivery is superior to standard intravenous or oral delivery for increasing the penetration of drug to the brain. Previous techniques using intra arterial (intracarotid) infusion still were non-selective as drug delivery still went to all blood vessels in the brain, so patients still had significant adverse events, such as blindness. Newer techniques in interventional neuroradiology have allowed for a more selective delivery of catheters into the arterial tree where chemotherapies can be delivered without the risk of adverse affects such as blindness. Therefore, this trial will ask one simple question: Is it safe to deliver a dose of Temozolomide intraarterially using these super selective delivery techniques in addition to the standard oral route of administration? This should not only increase the amount of drug that gets to the tumor but also spare the patient many of the adverse effects from a less selective delivery. Prior to this single dose of intra-arterial Temozolomide, the patient will also receive a dose of mannitol that will increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier to improve delivery of the agent to the brain. After this single dose of mannitol and Temozolomide, the patient will be evaluated for 4 weeks to assess for toxicity. If there is no toxicity at this point, then the patient will proceed with oral maintenance Temozolomide chemotherapy. In summary, this is a Phase I trial that is designed to test the safety of a single dose of intra-arterial delivery of Temozolomide immediately following 42 days of radiotherapy/oral temozolomide and prior to starting oral maintenance Temozolomide.

To summarize:

Current Standard of Care Therapy:

Days 1-42: Adjuvant dose of Temozolomide 75mg/m2 for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy Day 42: 4 week rest period Day 70: Maintenance dose of Temozolomide 150mg/m2 once daily for Days 1-5 of a 28 day cycle for 6 cycles

Experimental portion of this proposal:

Days 1-42: Adjuvant dose of Temozolomide 75mg/m2 for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy Day 42: Single Intra-arterial Mannitol to increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier followed by Intra-arterial Temozolomide single dose (starting at 75mg/m2 and up to 250mg/m2) followed by 4 week rest period Day 70: Maintenance dose of Temozolomide 150mg/m2 once daily for Days 1-5 of a 28 day cycle for 6 cycles

Therefore the experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:

1. On day 42, subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol 25%; 3-10 mLs for 30seconds) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the intraarterial (IA) delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.
2. Following the addition of mannitol, the investigators will deliver a single SIACI dose of Temozolomide for patients with high-grade glioma. After a one-cycle observation period to assess for toxicity from the IA infusion, the subject will receive the standard oral maintenance regimen of Temozolomide chemotherapy. The Intra-Arterial Infusion Procedure will be done under general anesthesia and standard monitoring will occur.

The dose escalation algorithm is as follows: The investigators will use a single intracranial superselective intra-arterial infusion of Temozolomide, starting at a dose of 75mg/m2 in the first three patients. Assuming no dose limiting toxicity during the next 28 days after the infusion, the patient will then begin standard maintenance oral Temozolomide chemotherapy regimen. The doses will be escalated from 75 to 100, to 150, 200, and finally 250mg/m2 in this Phase I trial.

Most patients with GBM are also monitored every two months with serial history, neurological and physical examinations together with serial blood counts, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and chemistries. In addition, most patients with GBM have an MRI performed every two cycles or approximately every two months to assess for tumor progression. .

Since this is a Phase I trial, response is not a primary endpoint. However, the investigators will evaluate response to the one time IA Temozolomide therapy with a MRI with the injection of contrast approximately 4 weeks after infusion. Follow-up of all patients in the trial after the IA Temozolomide therapy will continue until disease progression or death. Survival will be measured from the time of the dose of IA Temozolomide®. The investigators expect patients in the trial to be monitored for 12 months.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01180816,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

The study involves at least 20 patients (5 per tumor type) who will undergo a pre-treatment PET/CT scan following an intravenous injection of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2. The primary endpoints include the safety of the imaging protocol and the correlation between \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 uptake (SUV values) and PD-L1 expression determined through immunohistochemistry (IHC). Secondary endpoints explore the dynamic changes in SUV values in patients undergoing multiple scans and their relationship with clinical outcomes.

Scientific and Technical Rationale:

\[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 is a novel radiotracer with high specificity for PD-L1, enabling non-invasive imaging of its expression in vivo. This imaging approach complements traditional immunohistochemical methods by offering whole-body assessment, eliminating the need for repeated biopsies, and providing insights into the tumor microenvironment. This study seeks to validate its application in clinical oncology, bridging molecular imaging with biomarker-guided therapeutic strategies.

Study Methods:

Patients will receive a single intravenous dose of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 (adjusted for body weight), followed by a whole-body PET/CT scan after one hour. Images will be analyzed independently by two experienced nuclear medicine specialists. Tumor biopsies will be collected to measure PD-L1 expression via IHC, and blood samples will be assessed for circulating and exosomal PD-L1 biomarkers. For patients undergoing multiple scans, changes in radiotracer uptake will be tracked to monitor treatment response.

Data Analysis:

SUV values will be correlated with PD-L1 expression levels, clinical factors (e.g., tumor stage, histology), and patient outcomes (PFS, OS). Statistical analyses, performed using SPSS 29.0, will include primary correlations and secondary evaluations of imaging-based dynamic changes and their relationship with therapeutic efficacy.

Significance:

This trial will provide critical data on the feasibility of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT imaging in clinical oncology. Its potential to stratify patients based on PD-L1 expression and predict therapy response could transform personalized cancer care, optimizing immunotherapy outcomes and minimizing unnecessary treatments.

Timeline:

Patient enrollment is expected to last 12 months, with an additional 3 months of follow-up for data collection and analysis.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06690216,imaging; immunotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

Perifosine is a pill that has not been approved by the FDA which blocks a messenger that tells cancer cells to grow. Research suggests that combined treatment with both drugs is better than either alone, and that it is reasonably safe.","Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common subtype in adults, representing more than 50% of gliomas. Standard initial treatment for newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy to the tumor bed and chemotherapy with an oral DNA alkylator, temozolomide. However, recurrence is nearly universal despite standard therapy. There is no standard treatment at recurrence. Median survival is about 15 months from diagnosis and 6 months from recurrence.

NCT05140902,Accurate DCE-MRI Measurement of Glioblastoma Using Point-of-care Portable Perfusion Phantom,COMPLETED,['NA'],INTERVENTIONAL,12,ACTUAL,"Harrison Kim, PhD (University of Alabama at Birmingham)",3/28/2022,8/25/2024,8/25/2024,University of Alabama at Birmingham,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),Glioblastoma,Point-of-care Portable Perfusion Phantom (P4),18 years,,ALL,"The goal of this study is to test whether a new device developed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) can decrease the error in calculating blood flow of a brain tumor, leading to better prognosis. UAB radiological research team has been studying a cutting-edge imaging technique named dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , or DCE-MRI, over 10 years. This technique has been globally used to calculate blood flow of various tissues including tumors. Blood flow often serves as a critical indicator showing a disease status. For example, a brain tumor has typically high blood flow, so the magnitude of blood flow can be used as an indicator to identify the presence and aggressiveness of a brain tumor. In addition, an effective therapy can result in the alteration of the blood flow in a brain tumor. Therefore, the investigators may be able to determine whether the undergoing therapy is effective or not by measuring the blood flow in the brain tumor, and decide whether they need to continue the therapy or try a different one.

However, unfortunately, the measurement of blood flow using DCE-MRI is often inaccurate. MRI scanners may use different hardware and software thus the measurement may be different across scanners. The measurement may also be different over time due to hardware instability. Therefore, the investigators propose to use an artificial tissue, named ""phantom"", together with a patient. The phantom has a constant blood flow thus it can serve as a standard. Errors, if it occurs, will affect the images of both the patient and the phantom. Therefore, the investigators will be able to correct the errors in the patient image using the phantom image. UAB radiological research team invented a new device for this purpose named point-of-care portable perfusion phantom, or shortly P4. The team recently demonstrated the utility of the P4 phantom for accurate measurement of blood flow in pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. In this study, they will test whether the P4 phantom will improve the measurement accuracy in brain cancer.","Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant type of brain tumor in adults. Surgical tumor resection followed by chemoradiation therapy is the standard of care for patients with glioblastoma, but its prognosis is still fairly dismal (median survival time = 15 months). One major concern that prevents effective treatment management is the difficulty of differentiating between pseudo-progression and true-progression. Pseudo-progression occurs in about 20-30% of glioblastoma patients typically within 3 months after chemoradiation therapy has been completed. Pseudo-progression is a local inflammatory reaction caused by irradiation and enhanced by concurrent chemotherapy, which leads to a transient increase of blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability. The BBB, however, is also disrupted by new cancer occurrence. Therefore, both pseudo- and true-progressions appear with an increased contrast enhancement in MRI, and there are currently no established techniques to differentiate between them. Pseudo-progression is typically known to be associated with better clinical outcomes, so pseudo-progression mistaken for true-progression results in the discontinuation of an effective therapy, while true-progression mistaken for pseudo-progression leads to the continuation of an ineffective therapy that may induce adverse side effects. DCE-MRI has potential to differentiate between pseudo- and true-progressions of glioblastoma. The enhancing lesions of pseudo-progression are due to inflammation, whereas those of true-progression are caused by cancer growing. Thus, true-progression typically presents higher perfusion than pseudo-progression does. DCE-MRI can quantitatively assess the tissue perfusion by monitoring the dynamic change of MRI contrast agent concentration. Several investigators have demonstrated the potential of quantitative DCE-MRI to differentiate between pseudo- and true-progressions. However, the variability in quantitative DCE-MRI measurement across different MRI scanners remains a major concern, as it hinders data comparison among institutes to retrieve a reliable threshold for accurate prognosis and subsequent treatment optimization. A point-of-care perfusion phantom may allow high reproducibility and accurate comparison of quantitative DCE-MRI data across MRI platforms. The UAB radiological research team recently developed the P4 phantom, which is small enough to be imaged concurrently with a patient for real-time quality assurance, but large enough not to suffer from the partial volume effect. The P4 phantom creates constant contrast enhancement curves with very robust repeatability, and thus the contrast agent concentration time-course in a tumor, which is a major source of error in quantitating DCE-MRI parameters, can be accurately calculated in reference to the values observed in the phantom. In our previous study, the variability in quantitating the volume transfer constant of various human tissues across two different MRI scanners was reduced fivefold after P4-based error correction. The investigators hypothesize that the variability in quantitative DCE-MRI measurement of glioblastoma across different scanners will be significantly reduced when the P4 is used for error correction, leading to better differentiation between pseudo- and true-progressions. The goal of this study is to test this hypothesis.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05140902,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

The IL13 part of the drug binds to another protein, the IL13 receptor, when this receptor is displayed on the outside surface of cells. Cells with drug bound to the IL13 receptor take up the drug, and the toxin part of the drug then kills those cells. Since brain tumor cells display the IL13 receptor, they are potential targets that may be killed by this drug. This is a pilot study to visualize the distribution of IL13-PE38QQR infused into and around brain tumor tissue before and after surgical removal of the tumor in adult patients with recurrent malignant glioma.

Stored tumor tissue will be tested for presence of the receptor protein, which is required for study entry. Eligible patients will then undergo biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of recurrent malignant glioma. IL13-PE38QQR will be infused for 96 hours into and around tumor tissue through catheters that have been placed surgically. For the first 48 hours the drug will be mixed with a radioactive tracer, so that the distribution of the drug can be followed by a type of scanning called SPECT. Surgery to remove the tumor will be performed approximately 15 days after the end of the infusion. Catheters will again be placed surgically, and IL13-PE38QQR will be infused a second time for 96 hours. Radioactive tracer will be included in the infusion for the first 48 hours. For both infusions, SPECT scans will be taken at 6, 24, and 48 hours after the start of infusion. MRI scans will be taken within 90 minutes of the 24 and 48 hour SPECT scans. Patients will be followed closely with further scans and laboratory tests until completion of the study approximately 58 days after completion of the second infusion.","OBJECTIVES:

* Assess the distribution of IL13-PE38QQR following continuous infusion via catheter(s) into recurrent malignant glioma prior to surgical resection and a continuous infusion via catheter(s) into brain tissue adjacent to tumor resection site after surgical resection. 123I-HSA tracer will be used as a surrogate for study drug distribution.
* Determine the toxicities associated with administration of IL13-PE38QQR as described above.
* Assess the effect on distribution of IL13-PE38QQR of varying the catheter type (up to 3) and flow rate per catheter, keeping the total flow rates constant, for the pre- and post-resection infusions.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot study to assess the distribution of IL13-PE38QQR delivered by intratumoral infusion prior to surgical resection and by interstitial infusion into tissue surrounding the resection site (peritumoral) after surgical resection. Prior to resection, catheters will be placed in the region of the solid contrast-enhancing tumor component. The volume of infusion, the duration of infusion, and the concentration of IL13-PE38QQR in the infusate will be fixed. For the post-resection infusion, catheters will be placed peritumorally into areas at greatest risk for residual or infiltrating tumor. The post-resection volume of infusion, the duration of infusion, and the concentration of IL13-PE38QQR in the infusate will be fixed. For the first 48 hours of each infusion, IL13-PE38QQR will be prepared with 123I-HSA tracer as the surrogate for distribution of study drug. The type and number of catheters utilized to deliver the pre- and post-surgery infusions will vary. To maintain a fixed total volume of infusate over 96 hours, the rate of infusion will vary depending upon the number of catheters utilized. Up to three different catheter types will be tested. However, only the same, single type of catheter will be utilized for the pre- and post-resection infusions for a given patient.

To allow assessment of the distribution of the infused material, the first 48 hours of both the pre- and post-resection infusions will utilize 123I-HSA in the infusate. For the last 48 hours of both infusions, the 123I-HSA will be replaced by non-labeled HSA. The distribution of the 123I-HSA tracer will be measured by Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scanning.

Therefore, the use of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy is considered as Stupp protocol. Patients with recurrent GBM will be included in the ANCHIALE study.

The goal of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of using the NanoTherm therapy system in recurrent GBM.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. how NanoTherm therapy influences overall survival, and progression free survival;
2. what is the tolerance of NanoTherm therapy in terms of side effects (allergies, intracranial bleeding, infections, brain edema, increased intracranial pressure) and quality of life.

Researchers will compare NanoTherm group with patients undergoing Stupp protocol treatment for the abovementioned effects.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent glial tumor (glioma). The epidemiology of brain gliomas depends on many factors such as age, gender, genetics, environment, and lifestyle.

According to statistics, in developed countries, brain gliomas account for about 2% of all tumors. In the USA, there are approximately 12,000 new cases of brain gliomas annually, and in Europe, there are about 25,000. The average age of individuals diagnosed with brain gliomas is 64 years, although they can occur in all age groups. However, the majority of cases are diagnosed in individuals between 45 and 70 years of age. The global incidence rate is 3.7/100,000 for men and 2.6/100,000 for women. A higher incidence rate is observed in highly industrialized countries. It is estimated that gliomas account for 30 to 40% of all intracranial tumors. Approximately 50% of adult gliomas are the most malignant form - Glioblastoma multiforme G4.

In 2009, 1444 new cases of malignant brain tumors were recorded in men and 1362 in women in Poland. Men have a slightly higher risk of developing brain gliomas than women. The presence of genetic and hereditary factors, including mutations in genes related to DNA repair and cell cycle control, increases the risk of developing gliomas. Risk factors for the development of gliomas include exposure to ionizing radiation and viral infections (cytomegalovirus), smoking, alcohol abuse, overweight, lack of physical activity, as well as exposure to certain chemicals such as pesticides and solvents.

Recommendations for the treatment of Glioblastoma multiforme include:

Surgical removal of the tumor as the primary method of treatment. Unfortunately, considering the fact that Glioblastoma multiforme is a disease of the entire brain, complete tumor resection is not possible. Therefore, the use of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy is considered. This treatment is used according to the protocol published by Stupp in 2005.

Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy is used to destroy the remaining tumor cells after the tumor removal. It can be used after surgery or as a standalone treatment, especially in cases where the tumor cannot be surgically removed. The total dose according to the Stupp protocol is 60 Gy and is administered in fractions of 2 Gy per day for 5 days (Monday to Friday) for 6 weeks.

Chemotherapy: In the Stupp protocol, temozolomide is used during radiotherapy: 75 mg/m2 of body surface area per day for 7 days a week. After the completion of radiotherapy, temozolomide is used as adjuvant therapy - 6 cycles of 150-200 mg/m2 of body surface area for 5 days every 28 days.

However, the clinical effects of using the Stupp protocol are not fully satisfactory. The two-year survival rate after the full Stupp protocol (radio- and chemotherapy) is 26.5% of patients, and after using only radiotherapy, it is 10.4% of patients.

Supportive treatment methods used in the treatment of Glioblastoma multiforme so far include thermotherapy - hyperthermia and nanotherapy.

Hyperthermia involves:

* the use of elevated temperature to increase the effectiveness of radio- and chemotherapy
* thermoablation, in which the use of high temperatures - above 45°C - causes direct damage to tumor cells,
* magnetic hyperthermia (MHT), e.g. NanoTherm® Therapy (NTT), which has been registered in Europe as a method of treating Glioblastoma multiforme in cases of tumor recurrence Nanotherapy uses magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), which are used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

Hyperthermia and thermotherapy have been treatment methods studied in cancer patients and magnetic hyperthermia induced using nanoparticles is becoming the subject of increasingly advanced research.

In a phase III study, the use of tumor-treating fields (TTF) was evaluated as a first-line therapy in patients with Glioblastoma multiforme. Low-power electromagnetic fields using long waves are directed at the tumor area using external electrodes. According to the report from the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG), this method resulted in a 5-month extension of the overall survival of patients with Glioblastoma multiforme compared to patients treated with temozolomide, and the tolerance of the treatment was acceptable.

On the other hand, NanoTherm therapy represents a promising form of thermotherapy leading to an extension of survival, especially in cases of Glioblastoma multiforme recurrence. In the study by Maier-Hauff et al., it was shown that the average overall survival of patients undergoing NanoTherm therapy after recurrence was 13.4 months, which was longer (P\<0.01) than in patients treated according to the Stupp protocol (6.2 months). The overall survival after the initial diagnosis of Glioblastoma multiforme was also longer (23.2 versus 14.6 months; P\<0.01). The benefit observed in both groups of patients was attributed to the use of NanoTherm therapy.

Therefore, among the sought-after new methods of treating Glioblastoma multiforme that could increase the effectiveness of the current treatment, NanoTherm therapy is a procedure that significantly increases the survival and quality of life of patients. For this reason, it is planned to conduct this study, the aim of which is to determine the effectiveness and tolerance of using nanoparticles in cyclic hyperthermia as adjuvant therapy in patients with Glioblastoma multiforme.

The main goal of the treatment for each patient with Glioblastoma multiforme is to prolong survival time and improve the quality of life. According to the literature, the median overall survival of these patients is 9 - 12 months.

Patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme WHO G4 will be included in the ANCHIALE study.

Study Objective:

The aim of the ANCHIALE study is to prepare a registry that allows for the evaluation of the efficacy and tolerance of using the NanoTherm therapy system in cases of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

Study Principles:

During the initial visit, a qualification for treatment will be conducted, taking into account the inclusion and exclusion criteria, i.e., indications and contraindications for the NanoTherm therapy system. Additionally, an interview, neurological examination, and surveys regarding daily functioning and quality of life will be conducted.

After qualifying a patient for the study, he or she will undergo standard neurosurgical operation aimed at partial or, if possible, complete removal of the recurrent brain tumor. Then, in the place of the removed tumor, NanoTherm ASI will be administered in a quantity of either 112 or 335 mg/ml of iron particles. This is a sterile suspension of iron oxide nanoparticles in sterile water, characterized by a high specific ability to absorb heat associated with its superparamagnetic properties. At the site where the thickest layer of nanoparticles (NanoTherm® ASI) is applied, a catheter will be implanted allowing for measurement and control of temperature during the first activation in the magnetic field of the NanoActivator®.

Between the 6th and 10th day after the neurosurgical procedure, a standard computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head will be performed for routine postoperative evaluation.

After the first activation (10th day post-implantation of NanoTherm® ASI), the catheter will be removed. Subsequently, cyclically, for 6 times, the patient will be subjected to the variable magnetic field of the NanoActivator® to induce hyperthermia, i.e., increase the temperature of the site after the removed tumor and the surrounding tissues. Activations will be conducted on the 10th, 14th, 17th, 21st, 24th, and 28th day. The heat released by the nanoparticles (NanoTherm® ASI) into the surrounding tissue causes destruction or damage to the cells of the glioblastoma multiforme (hyperthermia effect), increasing their susceptibility to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

The patient will then be subjected to detailed observation for 2 years. Observation will include visits conducted on the 60th, 90th, 150th, 210th, 270th, and 360th day after surgery, and then every 3 months up to 2 years post-procedure.

On the 6th - 10th, 90th, 150th, 210th, 270th, and 360th day after surgery, and then every 3 months up to 2 years post-procedure, a CT scan with an evaluation of treatment efficacy will be performed. The treatment effects on CT will be analyzed using RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology) scale.

During follow-up visits on the 60th, 90th, 150th, 210th, 270th, and 360th day, and then every 3 months up to 2 years after the surgical procedure, a neurological examination, assessment of adverse symptoms, number of potential hospitalizations, number of medical visits, clinimetric assessment regarding quality of life (EuroQuality of Life-5 dimensions 5- levels \[EQ-5D-5L\], Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology \[NanoScale 2\]), and clinimetric assessment regarding neurological deficit and degree of disability will be conducted (modified Rankin scale, Barthel index).

The results from NanoTherm group will be compared to patients undergoing standard neurosurgical treatment for the abovementioned effects.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06271421,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

Researchers will compare the investigational arm, where clinical management is based on the index MRI scan and an additional FET-PET scan, with the control arm, where clinical management is based solely on the index MRI scan, to investigate the added value of the FET PET scan for clinical management.

Participants in the investigational arm will undergo the FET PET scan. All participants will complete health-related quality of life questionnaires at four different timepoints.","During follow-up of glioblastoma patients after chemoradiation, expert teams often observe MRI abnormalities with difficulty in distinguishing between tumor growth and pseudoprogression.

To describe the toxicity of radiation therapy,temozolomide and Avastin followed by Avastin, temozolomide, and irinotecan.","The standard of care for grade IV gliomas is radiation therapy with daily temozolomide, followed by 6 months of temozolomide. The majority of patients progress and die of their tumor. Many glioma patients are resistant to temozolomide because the tumors have high O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), conferring resistance. Irinotecan is synergistic with temozolomide, and the combination may overcome high MGMT. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is present on the cell surface and around malignant gliomas. It appears that the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor is a prognostic growth factor with more VEGF expression correlating with a poor prognosis. Monoclonal antibodies to VEGF have inhibited growth of malignant gliomas in a mouse xenograft. Avastin is a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IGG) 1 antibody that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor. The combination of Avastin and irinotecan was safe and demonstrated high activity against recurrent malignant gliomas. The combination of Avastin, temozolomide, and irinotecan as the initial therapy may maximize the chance for long-term survival.

The goal of Phase 2 of this study to learn if the combination of everolimus and sorafenib can help to control malignant glioma. The safety of this combination will also be studied in both phases.","Background

* Although malignant gliomas display genetic heterogeneity, several key proliferation and survival signaling pathways have been identified.
* Recent work has focused on targeting these tumor specific pathways in hopes of improving treatment efficacy and minimizing treatment toxicity. Because molecularly targeted agents have been mostly ineffective when used alone, combination therapy that inhibits multiple pathways is an appealing strategy.
* Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Although most GBMs lack rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) mutations, targeting the RAF/methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway may be beneficial as this pathway may be activated by other genetic alterations upstream from RAF.
* The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a downstream component of the Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Everolimus (everolimus; Novartis) is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin.
* Combining everolimus and sorafenib allows targeting of both the PI3K pathway and the RAF-MAPK pathway and in addition targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), other active targets in malignant glioma.

Objectives

Phase 1

-To determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of everolimus in combination with

sorafenib for patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.

Phase 2

* 6 months progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study.
* 3 months progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with prior bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study.
* 6 months progression free survival rate for Anaplastic Glioma (AG) patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study.

Eligibility

* Patients with histologically proven recurrent intracranial malignant glioma will be eligible for the phase I/II component of this protocol.
* Patients must be \>= 18 years old with a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60
* No more than 2 prior chemotherapies and 1 relapse. Prior bevacizumab therapy is allowed.

Design

* This is a phase 1 /2 study of everolimus and sorafenib in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.

Every year 1000 patients are diagnosed with this disease in the Netherlands. Despite neurosurgery, chemo -and radiation therapy, these tumors inevitably recur. Currently, there is no gold standard at time of recurrence and treatment options are limited. In a retrospective study in two Dutch neuro-oncology centers, the overall survival (OS) for patients with recurrent GBM receiving best supportive care was 3 months, while patients receiving systemic treatment (usually nitrosurea), radiation therapy or surgery followed by systemic treatment or radiotherapy had respectively 7.3 months, 9.2 months and 11 months OS. Unfortunately, the results of dedicated trials with new drugs have been very disappointing. For those to be meaningful, extensive molecular screening is needed.

The goal of the project is to obtain the evidence for changing standard of care procedures to include extensive molecular diagnostics and consequently adapt care guidelines for this specific patient group with very poor prognosis by offering optimal and timely benefit from novel therapies, even in the absence of traditional registration trials for this small volume cancer indication.

Objective: To determine the value of and generate the clinical evidence for routine application of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)-based diagnostics and targeted therapy guidance for glioblastoma patients at time of first recurrence.

Study design: Prospective diagnostic multicenter cohort study Study population: Adult glioblastoma patients with recurrent disease that are undergoing resection or debulking as part of their standard care and from whom written informed consent is obtained.

Intervention: A 10 mL blood sample will be drawn once to assess each patient's germline DNA background variation that will discriminate somatic mutations from the patient's germline DNA background variations.

Thereafter, patients will be followed through standard clinical examinations for the next 3 years or until demise, whichever occurs first.

Clinically, GBM patients are imaged every 8-weeks, beginning at 10 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation, since morphological (i.e. size) changes are not anticipated earlier. However, our preliminary experience and others have shown functional changes including perfusion and diffusion as early as 3-weeks after the initiation of the treatment . Thus, our T10, T18, T26 and T34 MRI sessions will be performed along with the clinical imaging sessions, while the T3 and T6 MRI sessions will be performed additionally for this proposal. All MR imaging sessions will be scheduled within ±1 or ±2 weeks of the target time period, as indicated in the table.

MRI including ASL will be performed before, during and after the treatment, in a total of 7 MRI sessions until 8 months after the first session. The research MR imaging may take approximately an additional 15 minutes per each imaging session. However, the T3, and T6 MR imaging sessions will be performed additionally for the purpose of this study, with each taking approximately one hour. Thereafter, patients will be followed through standard clinical examinations for the next 3 years or until demise, whichever occurs first.","Glioblastoma (GBM) represents about 15% of all primary brain tumors with approximately 19,000 new cases diagnosed annually. The one-, five- and ten-year survival rates for patients with GBM is 37.2%, 5.1% and 2.6% from diagnosis respectively, making it one of the most lethal cancers known, among all cancers. GBMs can be challenging to treat and new cancer therapies are continuously being developed for GBM treatment.

The high cost and potential risks associated with human trials for these experimental therapies have emphasized the need for sensitive monitoring of tumor response. Imaging approaches can play an important role in the evaluation and selection of potential new therapies with non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. Currently, the radiological assessment of treatment outcomes predominantly relies on morphological (i.e. size) changes using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and other similar scores. This is a major limiting factor as the effects of many therapeutic agents at the microscopic level precede the eventual changes in tumor size. One such tumor property that has gained increased attention is angiogenesis, which has been shown to support tumor proliferation and infiltration. Increasing numbers of clinical trials have begun targeting tumor vascular supplies either directly inhibiting angiogenesis (e.g. antiangiogenic therapy) or indirectly disrupting cell proliferation and eventually angiogenesis (e.g. cytotoxic chemoradiation). Such clinical trials and the eventual clinical use of these therapies would be greatly assisted by the availability of robust imaging indicators of angiogenesis (i.e. tissue perfusion).

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 15O-labeled water (15O-PET) is considered the gold standard for non-invasive measurement of tissue perfusion. However, the use of 15O-PET requires a cyclotron in close proximity to PET to produce short lived 15O-water (half life 2.4 min), limiting its applicability in clinical settings. Alternative imaging techniques include ultrasound using microbubbles, perfusion computed tomography (CT) using iodinated contrast agent and perfusion MRI using gadolinium based contrast agents. All of these techniques require exogenous agents, restricting their use in longitudinal monitoring of treatment response.

Arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI has recently emerged as a quantitative imaging (QI) method to measure perfusion (or capillary blood flow) without the administration of exogenous contrast agents. ASL magnetically ""labels"" the highly permeable water in the blood as a tracer and measures their accumulation in the tissue of interest, without injecting any exogenous contrast. Various versions of ASL have been validated in animals using microspheres, and in humans using 15O-PET in the brain. ASL also has a number of advantages compared to dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) based MR perfusion measurements. Specifically, ASL does not require exogenous agent alleviating the concerns of gadolinium accumulation or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with impaired renal function and, unlike DCE/DSC, the contribution of vascular permeability to ASL measured perfusion is negligible enabling absolute perfusion quantification in physiological units (ml/100g/min).",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03922984,imaging,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

Glioblastoma (WHO IV), and Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO III), are the most common brain cancers, respectively, representing over 70% of all malignant gliomas (ABTA, 2015).

Though rare, there is no cure, and the prognosis for these tumors is poor. Survival at 5 years for all CNS cancers is approximately 33.3 % (Howlader et al., 2014). For GBM, the most lethal of the tumors, with the current standard of care median survival is 14.6 months (Walid, 2008). Relative survival with GBM at five years is approximately only 5% (Ostrom et al. CBTRUS 2014).

For newly diagnosed tumors, the current standard of care recommends a multi-modal approach with surgery to remove the tumor, when possible, followed by 6 weeks of radiation and a concurrent daily dose of temozolomide (Stupp et al. 2005). This is known as the Stupp protocol (Stupp et al. 2005). Patients then have a one-month rest period with no treatment, followed by ""maintenance"" temozolomide, given five days out of every 28 days, for a minimum of six months. Some providers keep patients on temozolomide beyond 6 months, or until disease progression.

Therefore, more therapies are needed to help improve survival, reduce time to recurrence and improve quality of life for these patients.

Progression-free survival (PFS) with this treatment is only 6.9 months and relapse is the norm. The rationale behind the fact that limited chemotherapy agents are available in the treatment of malignant gliomas is related to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits drug entry to the brain. Intraarterial (IA) chemotherapy allows to circumvent this. Using IA delivery of carboplatin, the investigators have observed responses in 70% of patients for a median PFS of 5 months. Median survival from study entry was 11 months, whereas the overall survival 23 months. How can this be improved? By coupling radiation with a chemotherapeutic which is also a potent radiosensitizer such as carboplatin.

Study design: In this phase I/II trial, patients will be treated at recurrence; a surgery will be performed for cytoreduction and to obtain tumor sample, followed with a combination of re-irradiation and IA carboplatin chemotherapy. A careful escalation scheme from 1.5Gy/fraction up to 3.5Gy/fraction will allow the investigators to determine the optimal re-irradiation dose (10 fractions of radiation over 2 weeks).

Combined with radiation, patients will receive 2 treatments of IA carboplatin, 400 mg/m2, 4 hours prior to the first and the sixth radiation fraction. IA treatments will then be continued on a monthly basis, up to a total of 12 months, or until progression.

Outcome measurements: Tumor response will be evaluated using the RANO criteria by magnetic resonance imaging monthly. The investigators will also acquire a sequence that enables the measurement of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and blood vessel permeability that are all relevant to understand the delivery of therapeutics to the CNS. Primary outcome will be OS and PFS. Secondary outcome will be QOL, neurocognition, and carboplatin delivery.

In vitro intracellular carboplatin accumulation: Tumor samples from re-operation will be be analyzed for intracellular Pt concentration by ICP-MS. The amount of Pt bound to DNA will be measured. The level of apoptosis will be determined for each of the sample.

Putting together these data will allow to correlate clinical and radiological response to QOL, NC (MOCA), and to delivery surrogates for the IA infusion and intracellular penetration of carboplatin.","A phase II study in relapsing glioblastomas (GBM) using concurrent intraarterial carboplatin chemoradiation therapy.

BACKGROUND - Contemporary treatment of GBM brain tumors involves a first-line treatment in which the patient receives a surgical procedure followed by a combination of radiation and temozolomide-based chemotherapy1. Unfortunately, this regimen improves patient survival only modestly, with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 6 months, and an overall survival of 14 months. Glioblastoma remains an incurable disease characterized by relapse and disease progression. There is no established second-line treatment for relapsing GBM, and the most used (BCNU chemotherapy) results in a PFS of only 2 months. As the investigators have shown, treatment can be considerably improved by circumventing the limitation of chemotherapeutic agents(CA) to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the central nervous system (CNS).

The investigators have focused their research on 3 essential aspects of GBM treatment: 1) alternate delivery approaches to bypass the BBB; 2) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize tumor blood supply and predict therapeutics delivery to the tumor; 3) synergestic interplay of radiation and platinum drugs to improve brain tumor therapy. This is the first study to ever attempt bridging these 3 aspects within the same project.

Alternate delivery approaches to bypass the BBB.

Although different approaches have been tested in the researcher's lab to bypass the BBB, the most applicable to the clinic is the intraarterial infusion of chemotherapy (IA). It allows to circumvent the BBB via the first pass effect, resulting in a local plasma peak concentration increase of the CA by up to a 5-fold factor, maximizing CNS drug exposure. It also decreases systemic distribution of the CA thereby reducing toxicities and side effects. Over the last 15 years, the principal investigator has treated more than 720 patients using this IA approach, 422 of which had glioblastoma. This is the largest of such series. Based on this extensive experience, the investigators have convincingly shown that the procedure is safe and well tolerated. Using IA carboplatin in GBM relapse, a response in 70% of patients, and a 22 months overall survival + an increase in PFS to 5 months has been observed. This represents an impressive survival increase of 9 months. Time is ripe to improve these results in hope to cure this hard-to-treat cancer someday; hence the 2 additional measures discussed next.

MRI characterization. MRI is routinely used to monitor GBM response to treatment. This imaging procedure could also help guide treatment and predict responses. Indeed, the investigators have recently developed a novel MRI sequence that enables the simultaneous measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and vessel permeability; these surrogates are all relevant to predict delivery of therapeutics to CNS tumors. This sequence has been tested and has met strict quality criteria. This will help decide the artery into which IA chemotherapy is delivered, and predict CA delivery and possibly tumor response.

Synergistic interplay of radiation and platinum drugs. Radiotherapy is the most effective single-treatment modality for GBM tumors, but controls the disease only transiently. A way to improve treatment consists of coupling radiation with a potent radiosensitizer. Carboplatin (Ca), a platinum (Pt) drug, is ideally suited for this7. Our group has demonstrated that the addition of Ca to ionizing radiation produced significantly more DNA strand breaks. In numerous cell lines, combining radiotherapy and Ca was found to increase cell death. In a mouse model, the investigators observed a maximum antitumor effect with Pt-Ca administration at 4 h or 48 h prior to irradiation. This timing correlated to the highest levels of Pt bound to DNA. Concurrent Pt-Ca and radiation treatment represents a common modality for treating a variety of cancers. Unfortunately, since this class of drug does not readily cross the BBB when administered via the standard iv routes, such compounds are not used to treat GBM.

After years of interdisciplinary collaboration, the investigators demonstrated the following key factors in our pre-clinical F98-Fischer GBM model: 1- the use of the IA route increased Ca accumulation into the nucleus of tumor cells by a whooping 20-fold factor compared to the iv route. 2- While testing for 5 different Platinum compounds administered to the CNS by different routes, radiotherapy, IA carboplatin + radiotherapy was by far the best therapeutic modality in terms OS.

AIM - To conduct a phase I/II clinical study in which: (1) patients with relapsing GBM will be treated with a novel IA chemoradiation with Ca. (2) the new MRI sequence will be used to maximize the intraarterial catheter position in relation to individual tumor vasculature. Moreover, the investigators will assess whether the sequence can serve as a predictor of Ca delivery to the CNS, tumor response and patients survival. (3) Using tumor sample of each patient, to proceed to in vitro analysis of efflux pumps expression levels, DNA-bound Ca levels, and in vitro radiation linked to cell death study to predict in vivo tumor response. With this structuring and translational project, the investigators ultimate goal is to personalize GBM treatment for each patient based on the MRI and in vitro biological data.

HYPOTHESES - (1) IA Ca will show strong synergy with radiation and will act as a potent radiosensitizer. (2) MRI data analysis on blood flow, volume and vessel permeability will predict the extent of delivery of Ca to the tumor and the level of hypoxia affecting radiation effectiveness. Hence, this should allow to predict response to treatment. It will also help maximize the catheter position in the cerebral vascular tree. (3) In vitro intracellular penetration of carboplatin and radiation testing, as well as expression of efflux pumps will predict treatment effectiveness and time-correlate Ca binding to DNA with cell entrance flux. Putting together these data will allow correlating clinical and radiological response to quality of life (QOL), and to delivery surrogates for the IA infusion and intracellular penetration of carboplatin.

STUDY DESIGN: IA carboplatin and radiation - Patients with GBM progressing after the first line of treatment will be eligible. In this phase I/II trial, all patients will be treated at recurrence; a surgery will be performed for cytoreduction during which tumor samples will be collected, followed by a combination of radiation and IA Ca. A dose escalation protocol with consideration of the cumulative biologically effective dose and the normalized total dose will be used to determine the optimal re-irradiation dose in terms of acceptable toxicity and efficacy. We will use 10 fractions of radiation over 2 weeks. This will allow to benefit from the protective effects of fractionation (normal tissue repair), while being tolerable in the preservation of QOL. Escalation scheme from 1.5Gy/fraction up to 3.5Gy/fraction will allow to control for neurotoxicity. A 12 weeks observational period has been planned between each escalation to detect any undesired toxicity. Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) common toxicity criteria and grade III or IV will be considered significant. Pending the occurrence of such toxicity, the patient will be withdrawn from the study. Moreover, 3 instances of a grade III or IV toxicity will halt the escalation scheme. The prior radiation dose level will then be considered as the established safe level, and 10 more patients will be accrued at this level.

Combined with radiation, patients will receive 2 treatments of IA carboplatin12 (400 mg/m2), 4 hours prior to the first and the sixth radiation fraction (of a total of 10). IA treatments will then be continued on a monthly basis as a single treatment modality for consolidation, up to a total of 12 months, or until progression.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03672721,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the preoperative evaluation and planning of spinal cord tumor surgery. It provides detailed information about the tumor's location, size, and relationship to adjacent structures.

However, routine MRI may not always provide sufficient information about the tumor's stiffness or adhesion, which can impact surgical planning and postoperative outcomes. Magnetic resonance elastography and slip interface imaging can help measure the mechanical properties of tissues, including their stiffness or adhesion.

Nivolumab is an antibody (a kind of human protein) that is being tested to see if it will allow the body's immune system to work against glioblastoma tumors. Opdivo (nivolumab ) is currently FDA approved in the United States for melanoma (a type of skin cancer), non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer (a type of kidney cancer), Hodgkin's lymphoma but is not approved in glioblastoma. nivolumab may help your immune system detect and attack cancer cells.

Bevacizumab is a drug which works on the blood vessel that supply the tumor and potentially can starve the tumor by cutting off the blood supply to these tumors. Bevacizumab is commercially available and FDA approved for individuals with recurrent glioblastoma.

This study has two study groups. Arm 1 will receive the study drug nivolumab 240mg and bevacizumab 10 mg (standard dose) every 2 weeks and Arm 2 will receive the study drug nivolumab 240 mg and bevacizumab 3 mg (low dose) every 2 weeks. A process will be used to assign participants, by chance, to one of the study groups. Neither participants nor doctors can choose which group participants are in. This is done by chance because no one knows if one study group is better or worse than the other. 90 total participants are expected to participate in this study (45 participants in each arm).

Investigators hypothesize that an omental tissue graft implanted into our patients with resected recurrent GBM may be used as a readily available and accessible means of circumventing the blood brain barrier (BBB) selectively and focally. The laparoscopically harvested omental graft omentum would easily conform to many resected GBM cavities in our human patients with acceptable risk. The predictable and rich vascular anatomy of a laparoscopically harvested piece of omentum makes it an ideal tissue for cases of previously irradiated and/or infected wound beds. This is why it is successfully used in head and neck and skull base tumors. The permeability of the new blood vessels formed between the omental graft and the cortical brain surface should allow for improved delivery of chemotherapeutics and immune cells (macrophages and T cells) into the vicinity, extracellular space and microenvironment of the resected tumor cavity including the brain adjacent to the tumor (BAT). Milky spots within the greater omentum are very small white-coloured areas of lymphoid tissue will also provide direct deposition of immune cells such as dendritic, macrophages and lymphocytes into the milieu of the resected GBM. The milky spots are made up of mesenchymal cells and are covered in a layer of mesothelium. These structures surround the small blood vessels. The enclosing mesothelium contains macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells. They are also known as secondary lymphoid organs. Most milky spots contain extremely thin-walled lymphatic capillaries. In addition, the technique of fat grafting has been reliably used since 1990 as a way to improve and enhance wound healing, scar healing, as well as tissue augmentation and tissue repair following radiation injury.

All subjects included in the study will undergo standard surgical resection for diagnosed recurrent GBM. Following the resection, the surgical cavity will be lined with a laparoscopically harvested piece of autologous omentum. The patient's dura, bone and scalp will be closed as is customary. The subject will be followed for side effects within 72 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 120 days and 180 days. Risk assessment will include seizure, stroke, infection, tumor progression, and death.

Zotiraciclib (TG02) is an investigational drug that penetrates the blood-brain barrier and might treat brain tumors. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a drug used to treat brain tumors.

Objective:

To find out if Zotiraciclib (TG02) is safe, and to find out if it in combination with TMZ is as effective as TMZ alone in people with brain tumors.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older with a brain tumor that has progressed after standard treatment

Design:

In phase I part, the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design will be used to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Zotiraciclib (TG02) for Arm 1 (dose dense TMZ) and Arm 2 (metronomic TMZ) independently. Then a randomized cohort expansion compared progression free survival at 4 months (PFS4) of the two arms for an efficient determination of a TMZ schedule to combine with Zotiraciclib at MTD.

In Phase II part, a Bayesian design based on posterior probability will be used to monitor efficacy.

Participants will be screened with:

* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Blood and urine tests
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain if they have not had one in 14 days
* Heart test
* Tissue sample from prior surgeries

Participants will take Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus TMZ by mouth in 28-day cycles.

* Some will take TMZ for 7 days on and 7 days off. Others will take it every day.
* They will all take Zotiraciclib (TG02) three days before Cycle 1, and then on four days during every cycle.
* They will all get treatment to prevent vomiting and diarrhea before and for 24 hours after each Zotiraciclib (TG02) dose.
* They will all keep a diary of when they take the drugs and their symptoms.

Participants will have study visits. These include:

* Physical exam, heart test, quality of life questionnaire, brain MRI, and urine tests every 4 weeks
* Blood tests every 2 weeks

Participants will continue treatment until their disease gets worse or they have intolerable side effects.

Participants will also be enrolled in another protocol to test molecular markers for their brain tumor.","Background:

* Zotiraciclib (TG02) is a pyrimidine-based multi-kinase inhibitor that has been shown to have inhibitory effects on cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) and Fm-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3). It is orally administered and penetrates blood brain barrier (BBB). There is clinical experience in using Zotiraciclib (TG02) as both a single agent and in combination with other chemotherapy agents for cancer treatment.
* Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent that has proven efficacy in anaplastic glioma and glioblastoma. It was approved by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma in adults. Both a dose-dense (dd) schedule, 7 days on and 7 days off and a metronomic (mn) daily dosing schedule have been used to treat recurrent high-grade gliomas.
* Our preclinical data have demonstrated that Zotiraciclib (TG02) down-regulates cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) activity and its target proteins, such as anti-apoptotic protein myeloid-cell leukemia (Mcl-1), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and survivin. A treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02) and TMZ has synergistic anti-glioma effects in a variety of glioma models with different genetic background. This serves as the basis for this proposed clinical trial.

Objectives:

Phase I:

-To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus TMZ using both the dd and mn TMZ schedules in adult patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma/gliosarcoma.

To select the treatment regimen with better progression free survival (PFS)4 between Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus dd TMZ or mn TMZ at each of the MTDs following cohort expansion.

Phase II:

-To determine the efficacy of Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus TMZ versus TMZ alone in patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV astrocytoma as determined by progression free survival.

Eligibility:

* Documented pathology diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma \[WHO grade III\], or glioblastoma/gliosarcoma (WHO grade IV) with recurrent disease. If the pathology diagnosis is anaplastic glioma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, evidence of either intact 1p/19q chromosomes or molecular features suggesting astrocytic tumor must be present. (including, but not limited to α-thalassemia mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) and/or tumor protein P53 (TP53) mutation)
* No prior use of bevacizumab as a treatment for brain tumor.
* No more than two prior relapses for Phase I and no more than one prior relapse for Phase II.
* Patients must have recurrent disease, either histologically proven or with imaging suggestive of recurrent disease
* Tumor tissues available for review to confirm the histologic diagnosis.
* Tumor tissue blocks available for molecular profiling analysis.

Design:

* Phase I:

  * This portion of the study is conducted in two stages: The MTD finding and cohort extension. Two treatment arms and several dose levels are planned.
  * In the MTD finding part, TMZ with two alternate schedules (dd and mn) in combination with Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be administered.
  * A cohort extension of both arms will be performed at each MTD and the treatment arm with a better progression free survival at 4 months (PFS4) will be selected for the combination treatment arm for Phase II.
  * Pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic studies and neutrophil analysis will be performed during the cohort extension of both arms.
  * A maximum of 72 patients will be enrolled to this component for the trial.
* Phase II:

  --Patients will be randomized between two competing treatment arms: (""winner"" of dd vs mn) TMZ + Zotiraciclib (TG02) versus dd/mn TMZ alone using a Bayesian clinical trial design. The dosage for the combination arm will be derived from the MTD determined in the Phase I component of the study.
* The treatment schedule will be identical to that described above in the phase I component, with each cycle comprising 28 days.
* Patients will continue treatment until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
* At progression, patients randomized to the control arm (Temozolomide \[TMZ\] alone) will be offered the opportunity to continue TMZ and additional treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02).",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02942264,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

Common hypofractionated regimens deliver a lower biologically equivalent radiation dose than the conventional regimens used for younger adults. Whether dose escalated hypofractionation can further improve outcomes in older adults remains unclear.

This will be a hybrid randomized control trial comparing the efficacy and safety of dose-escalated and standard hypofractionated radiotherapy among older adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma compared to standard three-week course.

Intranasal administration is a new method of treating brain tumours for the direct administration of drugs, inhibitors or viruses, with minimal involvement of the BBB. The investigators know the orally prescribed standard chemotherapy temozolomide (TMZ) is widely used to treat glioma tumours.

Received evidence of safety and efficacy in a full cycle of preclinical trials (on GLP Standart) and tests of calculated doses of intranasal administration of TMZ in healthy volunteers.

Intranasal administration of temozolomide is considered as GBM therapy, which provides direct access to a therapeutic dose of the drug into the brain (to the neoplastic process) with low toxicity","The investigators are trying to evaluate a clinically potentially effective intranasal way of delivering TMZ to the brain, taking into account the anatomical structure of os ethmoidal.

The most important factor in the effectiveness of the drug is the achievement of an adequate amount of the active agent in its unbound state with albumin on the blood of a patient and the exposure time to the tumour process. Failure to comply with this requirement (difficulties in overcoming the BBB) was identified as the main obstacle to the successful treatment of all types of brain tumours.

By ""add-on"" what is meant is that the experimental intravenous therapy, RRx-001, is combined or ""added on"" to standard of care. In newly diagnosed GBM standard of care consists of radiotherapy + temozolomide (TMZ) for 6 weeks followed (after a 4-6 weeks break) by maintenance TMZ given until the tumor progresses or worsens. By ""maintenance"" therapy what is meant is that TMZ is given less frequently to prolong or extend the time during which the tumor remains stable.

G-FORCE-1 will be conducted in two parts; in the first part of the study (Dose Escalation, Part A) patients will be entered or assigned sequentially (that is consecutively) to gradually escalating or increasing doses of RRx-001 after patients have been entered on the previous dose until such time as it is no longer tolerated. At each dose level, a separate cohort or small group of at least 3 evaluable patients will be treated. RRx-001 will be administered by intravenous infusion (in other words, by slow injection in the veins) over 30-45 minutes once weekly during radiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by the FDA-approved chemotherapy, temozolomide (TMZ) alone for up to 6 months or longer.

In the second part of this study (Part B), new groups or cohorts of patients will receive RRx-001 at the dose established in Part A by intravenous infusion over 30-45 minutes once weekly during radiotherapy for 6 weeks. Then, after a 4-6 weeks break, each cohort will receive increasing doses of RRx-001 and temozolomide (in other words, a double dose escalation) to establish an acceptable safety and activity window, in other words, a dose range that is relatively free of toxicity as well as active against the tumor, although the primary purpose of this study is to assess or evaluate safety.

The reason or rationale to ""add on"" RRx-001 to radiotherapy and TMZ, which is described in more detail below on this page, is as follows: RRx-001 is a radiosensitizer and a chemosensitizer, which means that experimentally it increases the activity of radiation and chemotherapy in tumors. In addition, in other ongoing clinical trials, patients have experienced minimal toxicity or side effects with RRx-001 alone and also in combination with radiation in the brain; therefore, the hope is that RRx-001 will synergize or combine well with radiotherapy and TMZ in GBM without adding toxicity","Glioblastoma multiforme also known by the feared three letter acronym or abbreviation, GBM, is the most common, aggressive and deadly type of brain tumor, which is standardly treated with a combination of radiation and temozolomide (TMZ), an FDA approved chemotherapy agent, followed by temozolomide alone. One of the reasons why glioblastoma is so aggressive and deadly has to do with poor blood flow: it turns out that GBM has multiple inefficient and leaky blood vessels, which leads to ineffective and irregular delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor.

As illogical as it may sound at first, depriving cancer cells of the oxygen and vital nutrients that they need to grow actually makes them more (not less as might be expected) aggressive and harder to treat.

Here's why: for radiation to have an effect on the tumor oxygen is required since the combination of oxygen and radiation produces unstable and highly reactive free radicals; these microscopic free radicals are the equivalent of a spray of bullets, which ricochet or bounce around violently inside the tumor producing catastrophic damage.

Likewise, for chemotherapy such as TMZ to work it has to reach the tumor and when blood vessels are so abnormal that the blood practically ceases to flow the TMZ, for example, may either never actually get there or may arrive in such small quantities that it is ineffective.

The expression ""survival of the fittest"" also applies: under the poorly oxygenated harsh conditions, which result from this sluggish blood flow only the toughest and most resistant cancer cells survive, making the tumor that much harder to eliminate with traditional therapies.

Think of the blood flow to the tumor as a swamp or a marsh where the rotten water seeps and pools rather than flows and where only the hardiest organisms can compete for scarce resources and low oxygen, which partly explains why this GBM tumor type in particular is often so hard to treat.

This clinical trial, called G-FORCE-1, tests the safety, tolerability and activity of RRx-001, an experimental anticancer agent, with standard radiation and temozolomide followed by temozolomide + RRx-001 in newly diagnosed GBM. Evidence in animals and in human patients with brain metastases, that is cancer cells, which have metastasized or spread to the brain from different locations in the body, has shown that RRx-001, which has many anticancer mechanisms and is generally very well tolerated both alone and in combination with radiation in other clinical trials, increases blood flow to tumors.

The increased blood flow has three possible beneficial consequences: 1) more oxygen is delivered to the tumor, which has the potential to increase the activity of radiation 2) more TMZ makes it to the tumor, which has the potential to increase the activity of TMZ and 3) as conditions in the tumor gradually improve from intolerable or barely tolerable to more acceptable, treatment sensitive cancer cells may start to reappear.

RRx-001 is also thought to work by stimulating the immune system to attack the tumor; tumor biopsies or samples from patients in other RRx-001 trials have demonstrated the infiltration or penetration of a particular kind of white cell called T-cells. As a fourth potentially beneficial consequence of the increased blood flow from RRx-001, these immune T-cells may have better access to the tumor, which may, in turn, increase killing of the cancer cells.

G-FORCE-1 is a Phase 1 trial, which means that the main endpoint is to test the safety and tolerability of RRx-001 in combination with radiation and temozolomide and not its activity; however patients will be followed for responses to treatment and overall survival",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02871843,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Metastatic,Unclear

Proton radiotherapy and bevacizumab (Avastin) are used to minimize the possible side effects of this approach.,"A common second course of radiation therapy for recurrent glioblastoma uses 35 Gy in 10 fractions to a small area defined by gadolinium enhancement on MRI. This is based in part on a recent cooperative group trial (RTOG 1205, NCT01730950) with concurrent bevacizumab resulting in very low toxicity and borderline progression free survival benefit. We hypothesize that radiation therapy would be more effective for recurrent glioblastoma when delivered to a larger area defined by spectroscopic MRI.

Our group was a partner in the multi-institutional spectroscopic MRI guided dose escalation pilot trial in the first line for glioblastoma (NCT03137888) showing safety and efficacy of planning radiation therapy based on spectroscopic MRI Choline to NAA (Cho:NAA) ratio maps. A local Cho:NAA ratio above 2 (Cho:NAA\>2) is known to correlate with high local GBM burden on pathology. In this study, we will use the same technique to target radiation therapy to recurrent glioblastoma in a larger area of the brain harboring microscopic tumor. We will start with the conventional radiation dose of 35 Gy in 10 fractions to the larger area defined by the spectroscopic MRI. If this is safe and feasible, we will perform a dose escalation to 40 Gy in 10 fractions to areas of gadolinium enhancement and sMRI Cho:NAA\>2 since existing data suggests that those areas harbor the highest risk of future progression.

This study is sponsored by Genentech, Inc., the manufacturer of Avastin.

Avastin is the experimental drug being administered in this research study. Avastin binds a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. VEGF is produced by tumors and circulates in the blood. One of VEGF's main roles is to support the growth of new blood vessels. During cancer, VEGF promotes the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to tumor cells and help them grow. Avastin binds to VEGF, which then prevents VEGF from functioning. In laboratory studies, Avastin prevented the growth of several different types of cancer cells grown in animals. Avastin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Avastin has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of GBM and is, therefore, considered experimental. Avastin is currently undergoing testing (alone and in combination with another anti-cancer drug, irinotecan) in persons with GBM that have come back after conventional treatment.

Temozolomide (Temodar) is an anti-cancer drug that works by interfering with the growth of cells (including cancer cells) by stopping their division. Temozolomide was approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM in 2005.

Avastin and temozolomide are currently being used together in several research studies involving people with newly diagnosed GBM. Limited information is available about either the safety or effectiveness of this drug combination.","The study consists of the following: 1) a screening period of up to 28 days; 2) a treatment period of radiation with daily temozolomide that lasts approximately 6 weeks, 3) a study treatment period that will last until either your tumor grows or you experience unacceptable side effects; and 4) a 30-day follow-up period after treatment has ended. Additionally, basic information concerning your condition will be collected every 2 months after the follow-up period for the rest of your life.

During this study, Dr. Nicholas and his research team will collect information about you for the purposes of this research. This includes name, address, dates (i.e., date of birth, date of consent), telephone number, and medical record number. Slides of your tumor tissue that were used to diagnose your GBM will be sent to a pathologist to confirm the diagnosis of GBM. After this review has been completed your slides will be returned to the hospital that provided them. Preserved samples of your tumor will also be sent for a test to determine how effective the temozolomide might be in your case. Any remaining tissue will be returned to the hospital that provided it.

Screening phase (following diagnosis of GBM at surgery) To determine if you are eligible to participate in this study, you will undergo a screening process that will involve the following

* Assessment of your cancer by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain using an intravenous (in your vein) contrast material
* Recording of your general medical, surgical and cancer history
* Physical examination, including measurement of your blood pressure, height and weight
* Evaluation of your performance status (your ability to carry on daily activities)
* Neurologic examination (how well your nerves and muscles work)
* Blood sample for laboratory tests (approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons) to evaluate your blood counts, liver, and kidney function
* Serum pregnancy test if you are a woman of childbearing potential
* Urine sample
* Recording of any medications taken within the past 14 days

Radiation and daily temozolomide chemotherapy You will begin radiation treatment within 5 weeks of surgery. You will take temozolomide orally once daily (seven days a week) during radiation treatments (which occur Monday - Friday and last approximately six weeks). You will take a medication to prevent a rare form of pneumonia (pneumocystis carinii) that can occur when temozolomide is given on a daily basis. That may be either in pill form or inhaled. During radiation treatment you will be seen every two weeks by a study doctor at which time you will be asked how you are tolerating the treatment. A physical examination, (including neurological evaluation), will be performed. Blood tests (1-2 tablespoons) will be performed to assure that you are not having any side-effects from the chemotherapy.

Post-radiation treatment Two to four weeks after completing radiation you will have a brain MRI scan. Beginning four weeks after radiation ends, the study drug and temozolomide will begin. The study drug (Avastin) will be administered by IV infusion (through a vein) every 2 weeks. Temozolomide will be taken orally for five consecutive days of every 28 days. In other words, you will receive two intravenous infusions of Avastin and five days of temozolomide every 28 days. This constitutes a treatment cycle. These cycles will continue indefinitely. The dose of Avastin will be based upon your weight during screening and will remain the same throughout the study. The temozolomide dose during radiation will be based on your height and weight at screening. During the study phase, temozolomide will be dosed according to your height and weight at the beginning of each treatment cycle. The dose may be delayed for up to four weeks if your blood counts are low. If temozolomide still cannot be given because your blood counts are low for longer than four weeks, the temozolomide will be stopped but the Avastin may still be continued.

Your first dose of Avastin will be given as over 90 minutes. If you tolerate the 90 minute infusion well, infusions in the future may be given over a shorter period of time. However, if you do not tolerate the shorter infusion time, future infusions will be given over the longer period that you previously tolerated. If you experience any problems during or following the infusion, you will be monitored by trained staff until it is considered safe for you to leave.

The dose of Avastin that you receive may be stopped or slowed based on how well you tolerate the treatment. If you must stop treatment because of unfavorable side effects, you may be able to restart treatment once the side effect has improved or resolved. Your doctor will discuss with you whether it is in your best interest to continue treatment. If you stop study drug treatment, you should continue to return to be evaluated as explained below.

Temozolomide will be taken at bedtime on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours after any meal). Prior to each dose of temozolomide, you will take an anti-nausea pill (ondansetron, granisetron, or dolasetron) to reduce nausea and vomiting.

The treatment cycles described above will continue until: 1) your tumor grows, 2) you have unacceptable side effects, 3) you choose to withdraw from this research study, or 4) your participation is ended by Dr. Nicholas or Genentech.

During the first treatment day of each 28 day cycle you will receive Avastin. Your blood pressure will be monitored, and you will have a physical examination, a neurologic examination, and an evaluation of your performance status (how well you are functioning in daily activities). On the same day, you will begin temozolomide chemotherapy. You will have a blood sample drawn for laboratory tests (approximately 2-3 tablespoons), and a urine sample taken. You will be asked by the study doctor about any health problems you have and medications you take. Additional blood samples may be drawn at the discretion of your doctor as part of your standard care.

On day 14 of every treatment cycle you will return to the clinic to receive an infusion of Avastin. At that time, your blood pressure will be taken, and you will have a physical examination and an evaluation of your performance status. On day 21 of each cycle you will have blood work (1-2 tablespoons) to see how well you are tolerating the treatment. Every 8 weeks (after every 2 cycles immediately prior to your next cycle) you will have an MRI of your brain to determine measurements of your tumor.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00590681,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; pediatric,Adult,Metastatic,Surgery

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent use of anticonvulsant drugs that induce cytochrome P450 (yes vs no drugs or modest-induction drugs).

Patients receive irofulven IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4 or 1-5 (depending on dose-escalation level). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients (per stratum) receive escalating doses of irofulven until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive treatment with irofulven at the recommended phase II dose.

Patients are followed at 1 week and then every 2 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients (9 per stratum) will be accrued for the phase I portion of the study. Approximately 17-35 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of the study within 6-12 months.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00012038,chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

LITT is a minimally invasive surgical technique that uses a laser to heat brain tumors.

Pembrolizumab is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by helping participants' immune system work correctly to detect and fight cancer cells. Pembrolizumab is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for this use, though it is approved to treat other cancers.","Primary Objectives:

1. Phase I: To determine the optimal timing for combining LITT and pembrolizumab in patients with rGBM:

   • To determine the feasibility, safety, tolerability and side effect profiles for combining LITT and pembrolizumab at various time points pre-LITT vs. post-LITT (Phase I).
2. Phase II: To estimate the response to pembrolizumab combined with LITT in patients with rGBM;

   • To estimate the response rate after treatment with LITT combined with pembrolizumab in patients with rGBM (Phase II).
3. To collect and record the side effect profiles for combining LITT and pembrolizumab (Phase I and Phase II).

Secondary Objectives:

1. To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on systemic immune microenvironment in patients with rGBM.
2. To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on the intra-tumoral immunosuppressive microenvironment within rGBM.
3. Secondary for Phase II, to estimate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after treatment with LITT combined with pembrolizumab in patients with rGBM (Phase II).
4. Measure radiological response using both conventional RANO criterion, a modified RANO (RANOi) designed specifically for immunotherapy response assessment, as well as MRI fingerprinting (MRF), recently demonstrated by the PI and collaborators to accurately and precisely distinguish recurrent GBM from radiation injury.
5. Correlate clinical and radiological response to known biomarkers of GBM such as Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) mutations, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 (IDH-2) mutations, Methyl-Guanine Methyl Transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss and KI-67.

Study Design:

The Phase I component will involve up to two of a possible 3 cohorts of 3-4 patients each for a total of 6-8 evaluable patients. Each patient will undergo a stereotactic biopsy. If GBM or Gliosarcoma is confirmed by frozen section, patients will undergo LITT then treatment with 200 mg pembrolizumab IV. Cohort I will receive pembrolizumab on post operative day 14 and every 3 weeks thereafter. In the event that one patient suffers non-hematologic toxicity of grade 3 or more, or if hematologic toxicity is grade 4 or higher, the investigators will delay the 2nd dose of pembrolizumab by 3 weeks and a 4th patient will be accrued. If there are two patients in the initial cohort with non-hematologic toxicities grade 3, or if hematological toxicity in two patients is grade 4 or higher, the second cohort will delay initiation of pembrolizumab until post operative day 35 after LITT. Conversely, if there are no non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) of grade 3 or higher, the investigators will proceed to cohort IB using the same dose of pembrolizumab given 7 days prior to surgery, then every 3 weeks. Similarly, feasibility and safety will be addressed as above in deciding whether or not to proceed to the next cohort.

The Phase II component of the study will consist of additional patients receiving pembrolizumab at the earliest tolerated time post LITT:

* 14 days post-op
* -7 days pre-op;
* 35 days post-opto achieve a total of 23 evaluable patients at the earliest tolerated dose.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03277638,imaging; surgery; immunotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

* Pembrolizumab
* Radiation
* Bevacizumab, an FDA-approved drug for treating recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)","This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. ""Investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied.

How the Study Interventions work:

Pembrolizumab: Pembrolizumab has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of cancer, and information from these studies suggests that it may be beneficial in this type of cancer. Pembrolizumab is a drug (an antibody) that may treat cancer by working with the immune system.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

Radiation (Re-irradiation): Radiotherapy destroys cancer cells using radiation aimed at a cancer from a machine.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved re-irradiation as a treatment option for this disease.

Bevacizumab: Bevacizumab (also known as ""Avastin"") is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the growth of blood vessels.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved bevacizumab as a treatment option for this disease.

In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine if this combination (pembrolizumab + re-irradiation) proves helpful in treating this cancer. If the participant has already been receiving bevacizumab, the participant will continue to receive this along with pembrolizumab and re-irradiation. By doing this, the investigators will look to determine if this combination (pembrolizumab and bevacizumab + re-irradiation) proves helpful in treating this cancer.

This study will also test the safety and tolerability of this combination (pembrolizumab + re-irradiation) when given alone or with bevacizumab",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03661723,immunotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

Gamma-delta T cells are a type of immune cell that may help the immune system recognize and kill cancer cells. The cells have been modified to make them resistant to the killing effects of chemotherapy such that they may be administered in combination with chemotherapy without being destroyed. The chemotherapy that is being used in this study is called temozolomide (TMZ) which is the standard-of-care used to treat glioblastoma patients. The DRI cells are given in combination with a standard dose of TMZ and are administered through a catheter directly into the brain where the tumor is located.

There are four arms to this study for eligible subjects with either newly diagnosed or relapsed IDH wild-type (IDH-wt) glioblastoma (GBM). Arm A will enroll newly diagnosed glioblastoma subjects to receive DRI cells derived from their own cells (autologous). The Phase 1b, Arms B and C will enroll subjects to receive DRI cells derived from a donor's cells (allogeneic). Subjects in the Phase 1b portion and Arm B must have relapsed disease, that is disease that has returned after initial treatment, while Arm A and C subjects must have newly diagnosed disease.

Prescreening subjects will have a standard-of-care surgical resection of their tumor. Once their preliminary eligibility is confirmed, they will have a Rickham catheter placed which is a device typically used to deliver chemotherapy into the brain that will be used to deliver the DRI cells directly to the tumor.

Following the surgical resection, subjects in Arm A will return to the study doctor's office/clinic to undergo a procedure called an apheresis. This procedure will isolate the immune cells from the blood to help make the DRI product for the subject. These cells include the gamma-delta T cells that will be used to make the DRI cells. Once the cells for the DRI product are made, they are frozen and stored for future use. In the Phase Ib and Arms B and C of the trial, a donor will undergo apheresis to provide the source of cells for the DRI product.

Following apheresis and confirmation that the required number of gamma-delta T cells were successfully collected; subjects in Arm A and C will begin the recommended or standard-of-care treatment for newly diagnosed GBM. This will include six weeks of chemotherapy with TMZ and radiation. Subjects will then have about a four week break prior to beginning the maintenance phase of treatment. Maintenance therapy includes five days of chemotherapy, every 28 days, which is repeated for six cycles. The previously frozen DRI product is thawed, prepared and is infused on the first day of each five-day cycle through the Rickham catheter. Subjects received a total of 6 infusions.

Subjects in the Phase Ib and Arm B will only receive one dose of TMZ along with the DRI product every 28 days for a total of six cycles.

Subjects will be observed for a of minimum 30 days after receiving the first dose of the DRI gamma-delta T cells. Subjects will be followed for potential side effects.

AF is a 41kilodalton endogenous and essential protein encompassing antisecretory and anti-inflammatory effect. Endogenous AF activity increases after exposure to bacterial toxins and endogenous triggers of inflammation. The active amino-terminal portion of AF has been synthesized as a 16 amino acid peptide (AF-16) and has been used in animal experimental studies. Salovum® is a product based on egg yolk powder B221® and contains high levels of AF. Salovum® is classified as food for special medicinal purposes (FSMP) by the European Union.

Many tumors show elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) compared to the surrounding tissue due to vascular leakage, providing a barrier for drug uptake in solid tumors, as well as poor perfusion, resulting in hypoxia and relative resistance to radiochemotherapy.

In a mouse model of malignant brain tumor, preliminary findings show that intratumoral infusion of AF-16 greatly enhances the effect of simultaneous intratumoral temozolomide treatment (90% and 40% survival, respectively). AF-16 also has preliminarily significant immune modulatory effects on myeloid cells in vitro, but also effects on the secretion of immune modulatory agents from tumor cells. AF-16 was reported to significantly reduce the IFP in xenotransplanted human glioblastoma by inhibiting an ionic pump, NKCC1, in the tumor tissue. Both Salovum® and AF-inducing specific processed cereals (SPC) prolonged survival in the same models. Systemic temozolomide treatment combined with AF inducing SPC completely blocked tumor growth in GBM xenografts. Likewise, SPC treatment abrogated 90% of pre-established syngeneic tumors in immune competent animals.

Mechanistically, it remains unclear whether AF's effect in tumor models is mediated through decrease of IFP and/or immunomodulation. Also, an effect on the complement system through modulation of circulating complement complexes with proteasome units has been proposed.

Salovum® has been administered to patients with various diseases as, inflammatory bowel disease, Mb Ménière and mastitis and traumatic brain injury without signs of any adverse effects.

Immune checkpoint blockade, specifically those targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways, has shown efficacy in multiple solid and hematologic malignancies. Furthermore, as has been demonstrated in metastatic melanoma, combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with other immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown improved objective response rates, though there is a significant increase in serious immune-related adverse events. As such, current trials are exploring different doses, administration schedules, and immune checkpoint agents. One alternative approach, however, is to introduce a tumor-directed therapy such as a personalized neoantigen vaccine combined with these immune modulating agents (i.e. immune checkpoint blocking antibodies) to maximize the tumor-specific response but minimize the toxicity associated with increasing non-specific systemic immune activation by generating a potent and focused neoantigen specific immune response.

The treatment of GBM consists of a combination of surgery and subsequent oncological therapy, i.e. radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or combination of both at te same time. If post-operative oncological therapy involves irradiation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is planned. Unfortunately, in some cases, a very early worsening (progression) or return (recurrence) of the disease is observed several weeks after the surgery, i.e. rapid early progression (REP). Radiotherapy planning is based on this MRI in all patients. However, a subset of patients with REP have a less favorable prognosis with this treatment management. The investigators therefore assume that these patients need a more thorough examination to form a precise radiotherapy plan. The project focuses on this group of patients with a less favorable prognosis (with a more aggressive disease). Patients who develop REP within approximately 6 weeks after surgery will have PET/CT (positron emission tomography in combination with computed tomography) examinations using the radiopharmaceutical 11C-methionine in addition to standard practice. PET is one of the most modern methods of molecular imaging, a non-invasive in vivo method that allows physicians to study processes in the human body using radiolabeled radiopharmaceuticals. 11C-methionine is an example of a radiolabeled (carbon 11) amino acid - a source of energy for tumor cells and a building material for new proteins. This radiopharmaceutical is commonly used in the diagnosis of brain tumors and in the evaluation of response to treatment. For patients who undergo this examination, the radiotherapy planning will be adjusted based on it. The purpose of clinical trial is to improve the prospects of patients with REP.","Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive diffuse glioma that corresponds to grade 4 based on the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. GB is the most common primary brain malignancy with the incidence of 3 per 100,000 persons per year, accounting for 45 % of malignant primary brain tumors and 54 % of all gliomas. Despite the considerable improvements in surgical techniques, which enable more extensive degree of resection, wide application of more precise radiotherapy (RT) and novel chemotherapeutic agents, GB remains an incurable disease with a median survival of 15 months and 3-year overall survival (OS) of less than 10 % in real clinical practice. Clinical trials evaluating the role of modern targeted therapy did not prove superiority of this treatment strategy and results of GB treatment remains poor.

Current standard of care is based on multimodality treatment combining surgery, RT and chemotherapy with alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). Standard post-surgery treatment of newly diagnosed GB patients has remained unchanged since implementation of the recommendations of the EORTC 26981-22981/NCIC CE3 trial (Stupp regimen) that finished enrolling patients in 2002 and was published in 2005. Co-administration of TMZ improved survival from 12,1 months (with RT alone) to 14,6 months (with addition of TMZ). Continuing effort how to improve treatment outcomes is urgent clinical as well as research need.

The phenomenon of postoperative REP has only recently been explored with increasingly available MRI for both postsurgery and preRT indication and is currently of high interest. REP diagnosis is based on a comparison of early postoperative MRI findings (up to 72 hours postoperatively) and planning preRT MRI. Our retrospective analysis of 95 patients with GB treated during 2014-2017 revealed that 52% patients developed suspected progression at MRI performed for RT planning purposes. These patients may represent a subset of patients with a particularly aggressive phenotype of GB. It was consistently confirmed that the presence of early recurrence on planning MRI examination was associated with a more aggressive form of glioblastoma and worse overall survival. Higher risk can be expected in patients after fewer radical resections.

Currently, it is not clear what is the optimal approach in patients with REP. Whether to indicate reoperation of recurrence, to choose accelerated RT regimes with or without concurrent chemotherapy or administration of more aggressive and intensive chemotherapy with combined alkylating cytostatics. Treatment of these patients today is not different from patients without REP, and if so, it is purely an individual approach. Clearly, these patients biased previous clinical trials where no routine preRT MRI examination was performed. Currently, these patients are usually excluded from clinical trials, moreover, recent studies often randomize patients after the competition of standard adjuvant chemoRT without any clear progression on the first post chemoRT MRI. REP in MRI planning is a significant negative prognostic factor that should be a stratification factor in future clinical trials. The basic problem is the postoperative prediction of early recurrence.

Amino acid Carbon-11-labeled methionine PET (MET PET) is the most widely studied tracer for molecular imaging in glioma. PET is currently becoming progressively more established part of brain imaging in both pretreatment as well as follow up examination. There is increasing evidence supporting implementation of PET imaging into brain cancer management. Amino acid tracers´ uptake reflects amino acid transport and proteosynthesis which are increased in most types of tumors including gliomas when compared to normal surrounding tissues. Resulted higher tumor-to-normal brain ratio (T/N ratio) provides higher contrast and tumor discrimination comparing to FDG even through lower absolute standard uptake values (SUV). However, because amino acid tracer transport is independent of blood brain barrier breakdown, there is visible PET uptake for tumors that do not enhance on MRI or for aggressive parts of tumor with no MRI contrast uptake yet.

MET PET plays an especially important role in improving diagnostic procedures for treating brain tumors. \[11C\] Methionine is not taken up by normal brain tissue to a marked degree, and the sensitivity of MET PET for detecting glioma tumors appears to be high. It has been suggested that MET PET may more precisely outline the true extent of viable tumor tissue than MRI, whereas MRI has the capability to better delineate the total extent of associated pathologic changes, such as edema, in adjacent brain areas. MET PET tumor/normal tissue index of 1,3 was considered the threshold for malignant activity based on correlation to stereotactic histopathology examination. Usage of MET PET is limited by its short half-life to centers with its own cyclotron enabling the manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals. Patients with REP of GB need to start oncological treatment as soon as possible and it is not ethical to wait for other commercially available radiopharmaceuticals (FET, FLT and others) that have a longer half-life but are only available in limited ordering schedule. In the comprehensive neurooncological centers, however, the individual rapid preparation of methionine tracer, the most studied substance in brain tumors, is the unique option how to improve outcomes of patients with REP, particularly aggressive GB.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05608395,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

The antibody used in this study is called anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2). This antibody sticks to GBM cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called HER2. Up to 80% of GBMs are positive for HER2. HER2 antibodies have been used to treat people with HER2-positive cancers. For this study, the HER2 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now attached to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These chimeric receptor-T cells seem to be able to kill tumors like GBM, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are limited. Therefore, developing ways to prolong the life of these T cells should help them fight cancer.

We found that T cells work better if we also attach a protein called CD28 to the HER2 chimeric receptor (HER2-CAR). In this study we placed this HER2-CAR into T cells that were pre-selected for their ability to recognize Cytomegalovirus (CMV). This virus exists in most people. These CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CMV-T cells) will be more active since they will react to the virus as well as to tumor cells. These HER2-CD28 CMV-T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of HER2-CD28 CMV-T cells, to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with GBM.","When the patient enrolls on this study, they will be assigned to a dose of HER2-CAR CMV-T cells.

The patient will be given a single injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. The injection will take between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for 1 to 4 hours. If later the subject seems to be experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms), s/he may be able to receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if they wish. These additional infusions would be at least 6 to 12 weeks apart and at the same dose level received the first time.

Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests as follows: Physical exam, Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function, Routine heart function tests (Echocardiogram),Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies

This makes the need for action to investigate the mechanisms of action of new drug approaches all the more urgent. In the therapy of malignant intracerebral neoplasms, immunological processes between tumor and endogenous immune response represent a key phenomenon for understanding response.

In the CheckMate-143 trial, an anti-programmed cell death-1 monoclonal antibody disappointed by ineffectiveness in the vast majority of Glioblastoma patients (although a minority benefited significantly). This will be largely explained by the immunological milieu of the tumor. One-third of the cells in Glioblastoma constitute the microglia or monocyte cell population. These immunocompetent cells also serve as a protective shield for the Glioblastoma against a possible therapy-induced endogenous immune response.

Corresponding research is being conducted preclinically on cell cultures, brain tissue samples (immunohistochemistry, autoradiography) and in animal models. A major role is played by microglial cells, which perform the immunocompetent function in the brain. Microglia and monocytes have an activation state as well as an opposite of a suppressive one in their immunological function. This M1 or M2 concept is similar to the old postulated Th1 or Th2 principle in lymphocytes. Different purinergic receptors -P2Y12R and Purine receptor 2XR - are active here, respectively. Recently, antibody-based positron-emitter-labeled tracers have been developed for this purpose and thus, in principle, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in vivo is possible.

The subsequent clinical relevance of a better understanding of these processes would consist in a combined therapeutic concept, in which additionally an immunomodulation in the desired direction of the regional activity of the immunocompetent cells could take place.

Methods for in vivo imaging of activated microglia in positron emission computed tomography scanners (PET) have already been developed - e.g. translocator protein positron emission tomography (TSPO-PET) by detecting mitochondrial activation of microglial cells. Here, however, it is not possible to distinguish between pro- and anti-inflammatory function of the immunocompetent cells. However, it is possible to do so by specific receptor recognition. For example, the purinergic receptor P2X7 is only expressed during proinflammatory activity. For this purpose, the positron emission tomography scanners (PET) tracer \[18-Fluorine\] Johnson \& Johnson (JNJ)-64413739 has been developed in the academic research field. Patient cohort studies are still pending in this regard. Our intention is to investigate in patients with untreated Glioblastoma whether effective imaging of immunological disease activity is possible in this way.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05753995,imaging,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

During the entirety of the study, intra-patient escalation will be allowed. This will occur if the patient experiences are \< grade 2 toxicity at the existing dose, if no \> grade 2 toxicity was identified at the existing dose and no DLTs were noted at the higher dose level (if any patients had been escalated to that dose).

Despite current treatment options including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, overall survival is poor. Therefore, other treatment options are being explored and there is increasing interest in the possibility of using the ketogenic diet (KD), alongside current treatment options.

The KD is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet. This encourages the body to use fat (broken down to ketones) as its primary energy source, instead of carbohydrate (broken down to glucose, a type of sugar). KDs have been considered for use in patients with GB as this type of cancer is thought to use glucose as its main energy supply, which is of short supply in this diet. Animal studies have shown KDs may make GB more responsive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and could improve survival by slowing the cancer's growth. However, clinical studies are needed in humans to assess any possible benefits.

This trial will see patients randomly assigned to one of two types of KDs; the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) and the medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCT). Both diets follow the same high fat, low carbohydrate principles, with the MCT diet requiring the patient to take some of the fat as a supplement drink instead of as food. Patients will follow the diet for 12 weeks initially. The trial will look to enroll newly diagnosed GB patients, from The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust over a 12 month period.

The aim of the trial is to investigate protocol feasibility and patient impact by comparing two KDs in an NHS setting, with a view to informing future phase III clinical trials.","A prospective, non-blinded, randomized, pilot study will be undertaken in patients with glioblastoma (GB). Patients will be randomized to the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) or the medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCT) for a 12 week period (primary completion). If patients wish to remain on diet, they will be offered dietetic support for a total of 12 months (secondary completion).

The trial will be open to all Walton Centre Foundation Trust patients with a newly diagnosed GB, who have undergone surgical resection or biopsy within the last four months and who are going on to receive/ are currently receiving/ have completed oncological treatments (radiotherapy or chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy). Patients will be referred via neuro-oncology multi-disciplinary meetings and neurosurgical clinics, post histology. The diet will be offered alongside standard care, commencing within four months of surgery.

Both diets are high in fat and low in carbohydrate, but contain different types and amounts of fats. The MKD is 80% fat (predominately long chain fatty acids) and 5% carbohydrate, whilst the MCT diet is 75% fat (30% of which is medium chain fatty acids) and 10% carbohydrate.

A permuted block randomization method will be adopted, using 'sealedenvelope' randomization system. This will be set up and administered by the statistician, who is not involved with the recruiting of patients.

Patients will receive regular input from the trial dietitian. This includes clinical consultations at baseline, dietary initiation, week 6, week 12 and every 3 months thereafter and telephone consultations at weeks 1, 3 and 9. Patients will receive dietary and ketone monitoring education.

Assessments and monitoring undertaken at each consultation include anthropometry, biochemistry, compliance, tolerance, acceptability, quality of life and ketosis.

Informed consent will be obtained prior to enrollment and the patient may withdraw at any time.

An information study is also embedded into KEATING, to aid understanding of the patients' recruitment experience and viewpoints, by interviewing a sub-sample of patients and their relatives/ carers.

Based on data for elderly GBM patients and the limited data for patients with poor PS, hypofractionated RT or a short course of Temozolomide (TMZ) may provide survival benefit without the added toxicity and inconvenience of a more protracted treatment regimen.

In particular, treatment with RT or TMZ monotherapy on the basis of methylated O6 - methyl guanine - DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, followed by the alternative therapy at progression, may provide a safe and effective treatment regimen for patients with poor PS.

The hypothesis of this trial is that in elderly GBM patients with poor performance status (age ≥ 65 years and KPS 50-70), a biomarker-guided approach to therapy results in non-inferior overall survival compared to combined TMZ/RT.

Specifically, biomarker-guided therapy will consist of TMZ monotherapy for patients with a methylated MGMT promoter, and hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) for patients with a non-methylated MGMT promoter.

It is hypothesized that biomarker-guided therapy will result in non-inferior progression-free survival, reduced toxicity and increased cost-effectiveness compared to combined chemoradiotherapy.

Primary objective:

• To compare overall survival of standard vs biomarker-guided therapy in elderly and frail patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

Secondary objective:

* To evaluate progression-free survival following treatment in both arms.
* To evaluate adverse events according to CTCAE criteria in both arms.
* To evaluate health-related quality-of-life as assessed by MoCA and EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-BN20 questionnaires in both arms.
* To evaluate cost-effectiveness of standard vs biomarker-guided therapy

Methods:

Patients will be randomized to two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. Standard Arm: TMZ with concurrent RT (combined modality arm) Patients will receive 15 days of TMZ daily with concurrent RT. TMZ will be delivered at a dose of 75 mg/m2, given daily with RT. TMZ will be administered 1 hour before each session of RT.

After a 4-week break, patients will receive six cycles of adjuvant TMZ according to the standard 5-day schedule (days 1-5) every 28 days, up to 6 cycles as tolerated by the patient. The dose will be 150 mg/m2 for the first cycle and increased to 200 mg/m2 beginning with the second cycle, so long as there are no hematologic adverse events, intractable nausea or fatigue.

Investigational Arm: Biomarker based treatment MGMT (+): TMZ monotherapy Patients will receive TMZ at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 15 days on weekdays (Monday through Friday). This will be followed by six cycles of TMZ according to the standard 5-day schedule (days 1-5) every 28 days. The dose will be 150 mg/m2 for the first cycle and increased to 200 mg/m2 beginning with the second cycle, so long as there are no hematologic adverse events. Dose will be determined using the body surface area (BSA) calculation.

MGMT methylation (-): No TMZ will be given. Participants will receive radiation treatment with 40Gy / 15 fractions over a period of 21 days (3 weeks).

It is mandatory therefore to assess its impact on the management of patients with high-grade gliomas in order to provide medico-economic justification for its use. The article by the UCLA group showed that 18F-FDOPA modified 41% of management decisions for patients with brain tumors (Walter JNM 2012). However, this study comprised 58 patients, combined primary and recurring tumors, and was based on questionnaires sent out to referring physicians. A targeted study is needed, therefore, to make a prospective multicenter assessment of the contribution of this technique in the context of high-grade glial tumors and neurooncology MCCs.","Current treatment of high-grade glioma combining surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy has enhanced overall survival during the past 10 years, notably thanks to the "" Stupp "" protocol using Temozolomide. At tumor evaluation and post-treatment follow-up, decisions regarding management (change, discontinuation or continuation of treatment) are discussed during multidisciplinary case conferences (MCC) between neurooncology specialists and are generally based primarily on MRI data. New treatment strategies are more effective on tumor tissue but also affect the adjacent healthy tissue. These phenomena give rise to complex MRI changes which can make it more difficult to perform differential diagnoses between tumor recurrence and treatment sequellae, such as radionecrosis and pseudoprogression. Alternatively, they can conceal effective tumor progression (appearance of pseudoresponse under antiangiogenics). Classical MRI interpretation criteria have evolved to take these phenomena into account (RANO criteria) and are now supplemented by new MRI data (perfusion and diffusion imaging, spectroscopy). Nonetheless, cases involving an uncertain recurrence diagnosis are still frequent. PET imaging has also shown very good results in differential diagnosis between posttreatment changes. Fluorodeoxyglucose-18-F (18FDG) can be used for glioma follow-up (Varrone EJNMMI 2009) but produces false positives during follow-up. In this setting, over-expression of amino acid transporter LAT-1 in brain tumors makes amino acids or marked analogs more suitable for PET imaging of glial tumors. C-11 methionine and 18F-FET can be used, but 18F-FDOPA is currently the only radiopharmaceutical agent to have received marketing authorization in France. Recently, the UCLA group demonstrated that 18F-FDOPA could modify the intended management of 41% of patients with brain tumors . The present projects aims to assess the impact of 18F-FDOPA PET imaging on decisions taken by neurooncology MCCs for the management of patients already treated for high-grade gliomas.

Expected benefits for patients and in terms of Public Health High-grade gliomas are the commonest and most aggressive brain tumors. Current therapy combining several treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, radiosurgery and chemotherapy) has improved overall patient survival during the past 10 years.

This research will involve patients with glioblastoma. The drug bevacizumab (Avastin) is FDA approved for the treatment of glioblastoma that gets worse after standard therapy. For glioblastoma, bevacizumab is given by vein every 14 days. The purpose of this study is to see if bevacizumab works as well when it is given as a daily subcutaneous shot as it does when given intravenously. A subcutaneous shot is like an insulin shot or a heparin shot. The dose of bevacizumab given on this study is in total slightly lower than the FDA approved dose for glioblastoma.

STUDY DESCRIPTION:

About 10 people will take part in the study. Participants or caregivers will be educated on injection and given prefilled syringes to take home. Participants or caregivers will administer bevacizumab subcutaneously each day. The bevacizumab will be stored in the refrigerator.

Follow up visits will be weekly for the first 3 weeks, then every 3 weeks. After 18 weeks, the follow up interval can be increased to every 6 weeks at the treating physician's discretion.

Participants can keep taking the bevacizumab until:

* Tests show that they are not benefiting from it,
* The participant has a bad side effect related to study treatment,
* The participant can no longer comply with study requirements, or
* The participant or doctor feels it is no longer in the participant's best interest.","1.1 Primary Aim: To describe MRI response rate as regards edema and enhancement of glioblastoma and radiation- related brain enhancement when treated with subcutaneous (SQ) bevacizumab daily. See section 11 for detail on response assessment.

1.2 Secondary Aims: 1.2.1 To characterize toxicities of SQ bevacizumab. 1.2.2 To describe response rate as per primary aim (above) in study participants who discontinue SQ bevacizumab for any reason and go on to receive treatment with standard IV bevacizumab or bevacizumab-containing combination.

2 BACKGROUND 2.1 Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody cancer therapeutic which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and which has been FDA approved for the treatment of glioblastoma. Clinical trials of bevacizumab in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients documented edema and enhancement response rates between 75 and 100%, with consequent improvement in neurologic symptoms and decrease in corticosteroid requirements.(1-3) The FDA approval was based on response rate; there has not been proof that bevacizumab prolongs survival in GBM patients. The related VEGF antagonist cediranib can decrease brain edema in a manner comparable to bevacizumab(4) but failed to prolong survival in GBM patients in a recent phase III study.(5) Thus bevacizumab remains strictly palliative for GBM patients, a disease which in any case is not thought to be curable with available treatments.

2.2 Most monoclonal antibody therapeutics remain effective when given subcutaneously instead of intravenously.(6-9) Preclinical animal data show this to be true for bevacizumab as well, with 100% bioavailability for SQ as compared to IV administration.(10) In a mouse tumor model, SQ bevacizumab produced better antitumor effects than intravenous bevacizumab.(11) Some treatments are also less toxic when given subcutaneously - a recent example is bortezomib, which produces less neuropathy when given SQ instead of IV but is just as effective against myeloma.(12) This is presumably because of lower peak doses. There is no published correlation between dose of bevacizumab and incidence of the common side effects, which include hypertension and proteinuria, as well as less common but more dangerous toxicities such as gut perforation. If these toxicities relate to peak doses obtained after IV administration, it may be that they are less frequent in a dosing scheme in which SQ administration yields a low sustained and stable dose. It is not clear what SQ dose of bevacizumab is necessary to obtain benefit in GBM. Although the FDA approved dose is 10mg/kg every 14 days, earlier European GBM studies used 5mg/kg every 14 days and produced similar response rates.(1) This uncertainty about the required dose is, in fact, true for all the diseases in which bevacizumab is used; an example can be seen in two simultaneously published phase III ovarian cancer studies, one of which used bevacizumab maintenance at 15mg/kg every 3 weeks and the other half that dose at 7.5mg/kg every 3 weeks, with the lower dose study actually obtaining improved survival for participants as compared to the higher.(13, 14) It is possible that at least in GBM, lower doses might be better. Some theorize that the hypoxia produced by antiangiogenic treatments promote a more aggressive, infiltrative tumor phenotype. There is some thought that a less complete blockade of VEGF would decrease consequent hypoxia and conversion to this aggressive phenotype.(15) A recent retrospective series reported that GBM patients who encounter bevacizumab toxicity and undergo dose reduction have longer survival than contemporaneously treated GBM patients who continue at 10mg/kg every 14 days.(16) Thus it is ethical and perhaps even beneficial to explore lower doses of bevacizumab in the treatment of GBM.

2.3 The rapid and nearly universal response rate in GBM patients as regards enhancement and edema together with the direct palliative benefit of bevacizumab monotherapy makes this an excellent population to study an alternate dosing scheme. In this study the investigators propose to study subcutaneous bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with GBM and progressive edema representing tumor progression or symptomatic radiation aftereffects. All participants will receive the same dose of 25 mg SQ daily, which would translate into 350 mg over 14 days or 5mg/kg/14 days for a 70 kg patient - the same total dose used in the European GBM series and the same dose as is used to treat metastatic colon cancer. Bevacizumab solution is known to be stable in refrigerated prefilled syringes(17), and participants would take these home, injecting themselves after the manner of low molecular weight heparin. Participants would receive weekly toxicity assessment, and MRI at 3 weeks looking for evidence of response in terms of reduction of enhancement and edema; see section 11. Those participants with response would continue on SQ bevacizumab as long as they continued to experience clinical benefit. Participants not responding, progressing after initial response or encountering toxicity specific to the subcutaneous route of injection or discontinuing study participation for any reason would be offered conversion to standard IV bevacizumab as standard of care or other treatments as appropriate and available. Improvement in enhancement / edema among participants converting to standard IV bevacizumab or bevacizumab containing combinations will be followed as a secondary endpoint.

2.4 The study would be done as a Simon 2 stage, with an expected response rate as regards enhancement / edema of 90%. If fewer than 5 of an initial 6 participants show response the study will end and the SQ route will be deemed ineffective. If \>4 of 6 respond, then accrual will expand to a total of 13 patients. See section 10.1, below.

2.5 The convenience of a SQ regimen would benefit some patients with GBM. The current requirement for IV therapy requires the patient to travel to an oncology infusion center and have IV access placed every other week, which is arduous and cumbersome. In addition, if bevacizumab were effective SQ for patients with GBM, this would offer the prospect of SQ bevacizumab being studied in other diseases with the goal of devising all-outpatient regimens and liberating patients from the infusion center. Examples include ovarian cancer (for which maintenance bevacizumab monotherapy improves survival), hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and in combination with other subcutaneous or oral medicines (e.g. capecitabine, interferon) for the treatment of metastatic solid tumors.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02157103,imaging,Adult,Metastatic,Unclear

GW572016 is believed to affect cancer cell function by interfering with the internal signaling needed for the cancer to grow. The study will also determine whether the presence of specific proteins in the tumor can predict what effects GW572016 will have on the tumor.

Patients 18 years of age and older with GMB whose brain tumor does not respond to standard medical treatment and who can undergo surgery for their tumor may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and neurocognitive examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ultrasound test of heart function) or MUGA scan (nuclear medicine test of heart function), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, and computed tomography (CT) of the head. CT uses x-rays and MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to show brain structure.

Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

* MRI and blood tests before surgery.
* Surgery to remove the brain tumor.
* Follow-up MRIs every 8 weeks after surgery.
* Follow-up echocardiograms or MUGA scans every 8 weeks after surgery.
* GW572016 treatment starting 7-10 days before surgery and continuing until the patient or doctor decides it is in the patient's best interest to stop it or until the tumor worsens. (The drug is stopped temporarily for surgery and a healing period after surgery.)
* Blood tests every 2 weeks to evaluate the effects of GW572016 on the body.
* Blood test before the first GW572016 treatment and at the time of surgery to assess the effect of the drug on the cells and to determine how much drug is present in the blood at the time of surgery.

Participants are followed in clinic at least monthly while taking GW572016. While on treatment they keep a diary documenting their daily treatments. The diary is collected at the monthly follow-up exams. After the treatment ends, patients are contacted periodically by the research staff for the rest of their lives to follow the long-term effects of the study.","Background:

- One of the most critical challenges facing glioblastoma translational research is developing ways to predict, based on a patient's biopsy, which targeted inhibitor is most likely to provide benefit. The studies outlined in this proposal are designed to determine which glioblastoma patients are most likely to benefit from GW572106, and may provide a blueprint for analyzing promising new pathway inhibitors in the future. We anticipate that these studies will serve as the basis for biological endpoint based trials in the future. Thus, the overall goal is to evaluate the efficacy of GW572016 in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas in patients who are candidates for re-resection.

Objective:

* Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate for patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma treated with GW572016.
* Determine whether GW572016 inhibits the phosphorylation of its cellular targets EGFR and HER2, and the downstream PI3K-AKT and RAS-ERK signaling pathways in glioblastoma patients in vivo.
* Determine tumor concentrations of GW572016.
* Assess overall progression free survival and safety.

Eligibility:

* Patients with histologically proven intracranial tumors to include only glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and Gliosarcoma (GS). Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a GBM is made.
* Patients must be candidates for surgical re-resection (total, or sub-total) in order to be eligible for this study. Following surgery, a scan should be done no later than 96 hours
* Patients may be on a non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (Non-EIAED's). They may not be on EIAED's. If previously on an EIAED, patient must be off of it for two weeks prior to initiation of pre-operative drug.

Design:

* A Pre-Treatment blood sample (10ml) will be obtained in all patients for genotyping
* Pre- Operative: GW572016 will be administered at a starting dose of 750 mg orally BID daily on an outpatient basis for 7-10 days. (This range is to allow flexibility for planning surgery). GW572016 will be continued up to and including the evening before surgery.
* At the time of surgery 10ml of blood will be collected in EDTA containing tubes for pharmacodynamic analysis
* Treatment may be instituted postoperatively as soon as patients have recovered from effects of surgery and demonstrated wound healing. Treatment with GW572016 post-operatively should start no later than 28 days after surgery. GW572016 will be administered at a starting dose of 750 mg orally BID daily on an outpatient basis. GW572016 will be administered continuously; however, for the purposes of protocol evaluations, a cycle will be defined as 28 days.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00107003,imaging; surgery,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

1. Perform exploratory correlative laboratory studies by examining tissue markers of signal transduction pathways by immunohistochemical analysis using tissue blocks obtained prior to initiation of protocol therapy, either from the time of diagnosis or subsequent tumor resection.
2. Determine the relationship between tumor and blood biomarkers and clinical outcome of patients treated with the combination of targeted agents.

OUTLINE:

This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib, erlotinib hydrochloride, and temsirolimus followed by a phase II open-label study.

PHASE I:

Patients are sequentially assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

GROUP 1: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28.

GROUP 2: Patients receive sorafenib as in group 1. Patients also receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

GROUP 3: Patients receive sorafenib as in group 1. Patients also receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21.

In all groups, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

In each treatment group, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride (group 1), temsirolimus (group 2), or tipifarnib (group 3) sequentially until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined for each group. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first course of therapy.

PHASE II:

Patients receive sorafenib as in phase I. Patients also receive erlotinib hydrochloride, temsirolimus, or tipifarnib as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I.

Tissue that was collected during a prior surgery is examined for biomarkers by immunohistochemistry (in patients enrolled in the phase II portion of the study). Biomarkers examined include epidermal growth factor receptor, Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase (HER-2), Protein kinase B (AKT), S6 ribosomal protein, and Receptor-linked tyrosine kinases (Erk).

The clinical course of glioblastoma is invariably fatal despite multimodal therapy comprising surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy. Population-based median overall survival is in the range of only 12 months. Glioblastomas synthesize and secrete large quantities of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, driving epilepsy, neuronal death, tumor growth and invasion.

Rationale: Several brain-penetrating drugs that have obtained clinical approval in other contexts can inhibit glutamate synthesis, secretion and signalling, including (i) the anti-epileptic drug gabapentin, which is a potent inhibitor of the critical glutamate synthesis enzyme branched chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT-1), (ii) the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine, which is a potent inhibitor of glutamate secretion by blocking the cystine-glutamate exchanger system Xc, and (iii) the cognitive enhancer memantine, which can prevent glutamate-driven, calcium-induced neuronal death and tumor cell invasion by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptors. The omnipresence and pleiotropic functions of glutamate in glioblastoma lends rationale for a combined anti-glutamatergic therapeutic approach. The well-documented tolerability of these drugs support the feasibility of a repurposing approach in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy. There is limited commercial interest in exploring the activity of these drugs as anti-cancer agents.

Aim: The aim of the herein proposed clinical trial is to explore the tolerability and efficacy of combined anti-glutamatergic treatment as an add-on to standard chemoradiotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The trial is designed to explore the efficacy of a triple anti-glutamatergic treatment regimen to justify and statistically plan a subsequent phase III expansion trial.

Methodology: This randomized phase Ib/II, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter trial will be conducted in 120 adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Any study treatments will be administered orally in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy and will be continued until tumor progression. The trial design comprises a per-patient dose-escalation approach in the experimental arm, i.e. doses of the study drugs will be increased weekly to pre-specified maximum dose levels and will be reduced if toxicities attributed to either study drug occur. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and will be analysed by intent-to-treat. After the first 20 events in the experimental study arm, an interim toxicity analysis will be performed to evaluate study discontinuation and maximum target dose level adaptions. Secondary endpoints include estimates of median PFS and overall survival (OS), OS at 12 months, seizure-free survival (SFS) and SFS-6. Secondary objectives include the central review of neuropathological diagnoses, central response assessment on magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRI) utilizing the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group criteria, determination of quality of life of patients and their care givers, symptom burden, cognitive functioning, anti-epileptic drug use, steroid use and exploratory analyses of outcome among molecular glioblastoma subtypes determined by methylome and gene panel sequencing.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05664464,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Surgery

Despite multimodality aggressive therapies (surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy based on TMZ and adjuvant TMZ), median overall survival is only 12 to 15 months. This dramatic behavior is mainly due to the high invasiveness and proliferation rate of GBM.

In addition, GBM exhibits a high resistance to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Current strategies for the treatment of GBM are only palliative, and include surgical resection (which is frequently incomplete due to the proximity of the tumour to vital brain structures) and focal radiotherapy. A large number of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. alkylating agents such as TMZ and nitrosoureas such as carmustine) have also been tested, but they display limited efficacy.

The current gold standard first line treatment for glioma for patients less than 70 years old includes radiation and concurrent TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ (i.e., the ""Stupp regimen""). However, results are disappointing and there is an unmet medical need of new drugs in this setting.

The primary diagnostic test for tumors in the brain shows magnetic resonance imaging or similar imaging findings (especially single metastatic brain cancer) that make it difficult to distinguish between these two diseases. In addition, due to the specificity of the tissue called the brain, biopsy is not easy and sometimes biopsy is difficult, so non-invasive discrimination is often important, and it is important how much prediction is made before the biopsy. To solve this problem, various advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques have been studied, but they are all tests that need to be additionally conducted on ordinary magnetic resonance images, and there are many subjective factors, so complex data and statistical processing methods, and many cannot be easily tested. In addition, in all of these tests, accuracy is still reported at around 60%. Therefore, if contrast-enhanced FLAIR images can be obtained along with contrast-enhanced T1 images performed during conventional magnetic resonance imaging tests to help differentiate between two diseases, it will greatly help diagnose and treat brain tumor patients and facilitate clinical application.","Polyplastic glioblastoma and metastatic brain tumors are the most common brain tumors in adults. Polyplastic glioblastoma is the most common tumor among malignant primary brain tumors, and metastatic brain tumors are the most common brain tumors in adults. In the diagnosis of brain tumors, magnetic resonance imaging is the most basic and primary imaging technique to date. However, in the case of a single metastatic brain tumor, the tumor shape, signal intensity, contrast enhancement pattern, and peripheral signal intensity appear so similar that they are hardly distinguished from polymorphic glioblastoma in conventional magnetic resonance images. However, it is very important to distinguish between the two diseases because the above two diseases have completely different characteristics in clinical aspects, surgical method decisions, treatment decisions, and prognosis. Obtaining histological results will be the ultimate answer, but due to the nature of tissue called the brain, non-invasive tests are preferred, and sometimes patients (e.g., cardiovascular disease) or lesions themselves cannot handle surgery are in a very important part of the brain, so it depends on imaging techniques. In addition, the distinction between the two diseases through imaging is important in that it is important to predict in advance even if biopsy is performed through surgery. Therefore, various advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as diffusion-enhanced imaging (DWI), perfusion imaging (perfusion), and spectroscopic imaging (MR spectroscopy) have been attempted to better differentiate the two diseases through imaging tests. However, these images are additional imaging tests that need to be obtained after obtaining conventional magnetic resonance images and are usually accompanied by complex and various statistical analyses due to many subjective elements. In addition, there are tests that are difficult to conduct other than large hospitals with a certain size or larger. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the discrimination between the two diseases to date is around 60%. In addition, such tests are often difficult to perform in most hospitals, except for large hospitals with a certain size or larger. Therefore, if the two diseases can be better identified in conventional magnetic resonance imaging, it will be of great help to patient care clinically and it is expected that actual clinical application will be easier.

Aggressive brain tumors like glioma have the ability to infiltrate the surrounding healthy brain tissue, disrupting normal neuronal activities and leading to impaired motor and cognitive functions, as well as causing epilepsy. This malignant brain tumor is considered one of the most challenging cancers to treat, with a median survival of 12 to 15 months. Recent findings on direct neuron-tumor interactions indicate that abnormal brain activity in the regions surrounding brain tumors may contribute to develop epilepsy and accelerating tumor growth. Tumors tend to 'fuel' themselves with neurotransmitters released during its 'daily' neuronal firing. Hyperactive neurons in the peritumoral cortex can form excitatory electrochemical synapses with surrounding tumor cells, creating direct communication pathways within the peritumoral microenvironment, which aids in the progression and proliferation of tumor cells via direct and paracrine signalling pathways. However, the specific features of this abnormal brain activity in the peritumoral cortex have not been fully clarified and information on the pathological changes of neuronal activity in glioma patients is largely lacking. To advance more effective treatment strategies, it is crucial to better understand the complex interactions between the tumor and the brain.

This is especially important for the group of patients of which many perceive diminished quality of life because of epilepsy, cognitive functioning and language problems after tumor surgery. Furthermore, a thorough understanding is lacking of what tumor resection does to the original hyperactive peritumoral cortex and if resecting this is beneficial for improving postoperative outcome both for epilepsy as well as regarding survival. Therefore, identifying the hyperactive peritumoral cortex and directly addressing its impacts on the brain function and long-term surgical outcome could be a promising novel therapeutic strategy for treating glioma patients.

STUDY AIM

The measurement focuses on capturing neuronal activity at single-neuron resolution in the peritumoral cortex of glioma patients using cortical depth electrodes. It is well-established that gliomas can remodel the surrounding brain tissue, leading to abnormal neuronal hyperactivity, which contributes to tumor progression and epilepsy. However, the specific neuronal patterns and underlying mechanisms of these changes are not yet fully understood. This study will aim to collect detailed single-neuron recordings in this context, enabling us to map the precise neurophysiological disruptions caused by gliomas. On the long term, this research could lay the groundwork in identifying novel therapeutic approaches by providing critical in-sights into how gliomas alter brain function.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06617208,surgery,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

The purpose of this first-in-pediatrics study is to examine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0084 and to estimate its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when administered to pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or other diffuse midline H3 K27M-mutant gliomas after they have received radiation therapy (RT). GDC-0084 is a brain-penetrant inhibitor of a growth-promoting cell signaling pathway that is dysregulated in the majority of diffuse midline glioma tumor cells. This study is also designed to enable a preliminary assessment of the antitumor activity of single-agent GDC-0084, in the hope of enabling rational combination therapy with systemic therapy and/or radiation therapy (RT) in this patient population, which is in desperate need of therapeutic advances.

1. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dosage (RP2D) of GDC-0084 in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed diffuse midline glioma, including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)
2. To define and describe the toxicities associated with administering GDC-0084 after radiation therapy (RT) in a pediatric population
3. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0084 in a pediatric population

Secondary Objectives

1. To estimate the rate and duration of radiographic response in patients with newly diagnosed DIPG or other diffuse midline glioma treated with RT followed by GDC-0084

Temozolomide (TMZ) combined with radiotherapy was the first substance to significantly improve the overall survival (to 14.6 months) as compared to surgery and radiotherapy alone and increased the proportion of patients surviving more than 2 years to 26%. TMZ showed the best efficacy in patients with a methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter in part by eliminating stem cell-like tumor cells. Among patients with a methylated MGMT promoter, the median survival after treatment with combined radio-chemotherapy was 21.7 months, as compared to 15.3 months among those who were assigned to radiotherapy only. In the absence of methylation of the MGMT promoter, there was a smaller and statistically insignificant difference in survival between the treatment groups.

Doxorubicin is one of the most effective substances in vitro against cells derived from glioblastoma. However, it has no significant effect in vivo due to poor blood-brain-barrier penetration. In a tumor model, tissue and CSF-concentrations of doxorubicin were substantially increased when sterically stabilized liposomes were used resulting in a comparable clinical response using approximately half of the dose of stabilized liposomes compared to conventional doxorubicin. A pegylated formulation (PEG-liposomal Doxorubicin) even further improved the penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Case series and two phase II-studies in patients with recurrent glioblastoma have shown modestly promising results for PEG-Dox.

In this study, the investigators treated patients with recurrent glioblastoma with 20 mg/m2 PEG-Dox on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. To determine the dose limiting toxicity of PEG-Dox combined with prolonged administration of TMZ, the investigators performed a phase I part ahead of the phase II study. To investigate, by means of a historical control analysis, if the addition of PEG-Dox to TMZ and radiotherapy improves the survival of patients, the investigators chose similar inclusion criteria and identical TMZ and radiotherapeutic regimes as in the EORTC26981/NCIC-CE.3 study.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00944801,chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

However, the prognosis of unresectable GBM remains poor despite chemoradiation with an estimated 10 month median survival, in the range of the comparable patients in the RPA class V from the EORTC study (Miramanoff, 2006).

Vredenburgh et al. from the Duke University (Durham, NC) reported at ASCO 2006 (fully published in J Clin Oncol, 2007) a 57 % unexpected response rate using a bevacizumab/irinotecan schedule in patients with relapsed GBM or grade 3 astrocytomas. This unusual high response rate, sometimes with major and sustained responses, was confirmed by a cooperative french study of ANOCEF (Guiu et al., 2008). Such a major improvement of treatment effectiveness lead ANOCEF, which federates most of the active neuro-oncology teams in France, to propose a neo-adjuvant and adjuvant bevacizumab-based chemotherapy framing a standard temozolomide-based chemoradiation with the aim to improve the prognosis of unresectable GBM.

The bevacizumab/temozolomide combination as neo-adjuvant is presently being evaluated by the Duke University. We believe that an ambitious comparison of the bevacizumab/irinotecan-schedule with the ''standard'' temozolomide-based chemoradiation is a fascinating challenge to improve the treatment of this awful disease.

High grade gliomas are a common brain tumor that share this enhancement pattern. The goal of surgery is to resect this contrast enhancing part without causing additional neurological damage. Intraoperative MRI (iMRI) is a helpful tool in achieving this goal, because it can provide updated images during resection and correct for deformations that occur in the brain during surgery. These deformations make preoperative images that are used for standard neuronavigation systems less reliable. However, due to manipulations during surgery, the contrast uptake during surgery may differ from contrast uptake in diagnostic MRI. This study aims to relate contrast enhancement on iMRI and tumor characteristics on tissue samples from the tumor. When the neurosurgeon considers the resection of the high grade glioma to be complete, an iMRI scan will be made, and tissue sampling will be performed on the borderzones of the tumor or tumor resection cavity respectively.

This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA, from initial diagnosis, despite multimodal treatment approaches. Initial therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. The role of adjuvant or concomitant chemotherapy in the initial therapy of GBM and AA has not, as yet, been clearly defined. Since most of these patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. In August 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan drug status for Erlotinib in patients with malignant glioma. Erlotinib (OSI-774) has been shown to be active in a range of tumors including GBM, AA and non small cell lung cancer. Because of the promising results in preliminary studies of Erlotinib and because of significant experience with the safety of the dosages proposed in this study, this study will offer a safe adjuvant treatment for patients with relapsing recurring glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma.

Despite maximal treatment tumor relapse occurs regularly accompanied by unfavourable prognosis. Among other reasons, it is believed that this could be in part due to the existence of the so-called tumor stem cells (TSCs), a cellular subfraction within GBM which escape therapy by being highly resistant to irradiation and chemotherapy and thus constituting the source of tumor recurrence.

GBM, like many other cancers, show a sub-population of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) overexpressing TSCs. More specifically, ALDH1A1, a cytoplasmatic isoform of ALDH, proved to be a novel stem cell marker in human GBM. In addition, ALDH1A1 has been shown to be a mediator for resistance of GBM to temozolomide (TMZ) and a reliable predictor of clinical outcome; prognosis of patients with a high level of ALDH1A1 expression was poor compared with that of patients with low levels. Consequently, ALDH1A1 may serve as a potential target to improve treatment of human GBM through inhibition of the enzyme.

Disulfiram (DSF) has been used for more than sixty years in the treatment of chronic alcoholism because of the unpleasant symptoms it provokes after ethanol intake. The underlying mechanism is believed to be the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood, due to inhibition of the liver ALDHs. Actually, DSF is a strong inhibitor of ALDH1A1 and relatively non-toxic at therapeutic (for chronic alcoholism) doses that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. In addition, DSF has been shown to be cytotoxic on GBM stem-like cells, inhibiting the growth of TMZ resistant GBM cells and blocking self-renewal by \~100% , while it has been identified as an inhibitor of human GBM stem cells in high-throughput chemical screens. Interestingly, a number of these actions were copper-dependent.

In the current Phase II clinical trial, DSF/copper combination will be tested as an adjunctive and concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. According to our hypothesis, initiation of DSF chemotherapy after the resection of the tumor and before the introduction of the standard radio-chemotherapy will inhibit ALDH1A1 of GBM TSCs making them more susceptible to radio-chemotherapy and possibly reducing the recurrence rate of GBM. On the other hand, the addition of copper will probably enhance the cytotoxic effects of DSF possibly through augmentation of its pro-apoptotic and proteasomal inhibitory actions.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01777919,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Unclear

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved rQNestin34.5v.2 as a treatment for any disease. This is the first time that rQnestin34.5v.2 will be given to humans.

The research drug, rQNestin34.5v.2, is an oncolytic viral vector made from the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). The large majority of humans already have regular HSV1 in their nervous system. Normally, this virus can cause cold sores in areas like the lips, fingers and genitals in humans by making copies of itself in normal healthy cells. In some cases, HSV1 can cause severe infection of the brain and liver and/or death. However, scientists have removed or changed parts of the rQNestin virus being used on this study so it can only make copies of itself in glioma cells and not normal healthy cells.

If it is effective, the rQNestin34.5v.2 drug will spread to a glioma cell, kill it, and then make a copy of itself and spread again. This should be repeated over and over until all glioma cells are reached. If rQNestin34.5v.2 moves into a normal brain cell, it should not grow and make copies, and therefore should not spread to other normal brain cells.

The purpose of this research study is to test if rQnestin34.5v.2 is safe to use in humans, and if it is effective in treating malignant glioma.

The current treatment of glioblastoma consists of maximal safe surgery combined with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT). However, despite this aggressive treatment, these patients still face a poor prognosis (median overall survival 14.5 - 18.5 months). In addition to that, around 30% of the patients diagnosed with a glioblastoma are not suitable for surgery. These patients miss the benefit of a resection and face an even worse prognosis (median overall survival 5.1 months).

The primary aim of this project is to investigate whether laser therapy combined with CRT improves overall survival, without compromising quality of life, in comparison with CRT alone in patients with primary irresectable glioblastoma.","RATIONALE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with about 1000 new patients facing this diagnosis each year in the Netherlands alone. It is also one of the most devastating malignancies and due to relatively young age at presentation (median 59 years), GBMs are responsible for up to 7% of total life years lost from cancer before the age of 70. Despite many efforts, patients with glioblastoma face a poor prognosis, with 2-year survival less than 20%. Current standard of care includes maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Subtotal and gross total resection have been associated with significantly longer survival (median OS: 14.5-18.5 months; RR: 0.71-0.84) 6,7, but in 30% of patients surgery is not feasible. These patients miss the benefit of surgical resection and with CRT alone have a profoundly worse survival (median 5.1 months). Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is recently growing as a minimally invasive alternative to treat brain tumors. Multiple studies have shown the application of LITT in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, in radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistant metastases or in tumors in difficult accessible locations, with promising initial results. A recent systematic review of current phase I/II studies in patients with newly diagnosed irresectable glioblastoma who received LITT yields a mean survival of 10.2 months, i.e. twice as long as with CRT alone (5.1 months). However, there is currently no high-quality prospective evidence directly comparing LITT with standard of care, precluding any conclusions on (cost-)effectiveness. After conducting a pilot study at Radboud University Medical Center to locally confirm safety and feasibility of LITT in patients with irresectable glioblastoma, we propose a prospective multicenter randomized controlled study to evaluate (cost-)effectiveness of this technique.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to prove an improvement in survival without substantially compromising quality-of-life (QoL) in patients with primary irresectable glioblastoma (GBM) treated with LITT plus chemoradiation therapy (CRT) vs. CRT alone.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial. Study population: Adult (\>18 years old) patients with a radiologically suspected diagnosis of primary glioblastoma not amenable for surgical resection.

INTERVENTION: Patients will be randomized to receive either (i) biopsy and LITT, followed by standard CRT or (ii) biopsy alone, followed by standard CRT.

MAIN STUDY PARAMETERS/ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoints are overall survival (OS) and quality-of-life (QoL) using QLQ-C30+BN20 questionnaire 5 months after randomization.

Secondary endpoints are disease-specific and progression-free survival (PFS), generic QoL using EQ5D-5L and QLQ-C30+BN20, complication rates, tumor volume response, effects on adjuvant treatment and costs.

NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE BURDER AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICIPATION, BENEFIT AND GROUP RELATEDNESS: We hypothesize that the addition of LITT provides patients with an irresectable glioblastoma a relevant survival benefit without compromising their quality of life as compared to current standard treatment. LITT has been shown to carry limited risk of post-operative complications, mostly reversible, and has been associated with fast recovery post-treatment. The main risks associated to the procedure are bleeding, brain edema, neurological deterioration, operation site infection, epilepsy. The results of our near-finished pilot study are showing that the procedure seems to be safe and feasible.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05318612,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

PURPOSE: Our primary long-term goal is to improve the completeness of surgical resection of malignant brain tumor through image- guided fluorescence localization. We hypothesize that the use of qualitative fluorescence imaging and point PpIX concentration quantification will enable more complete tumor resection than normal direct (i.e., white light) visualization, and thereby improve participant survival.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Assess 2 doses of 5-ALA, 10kg/mg and 20kg/mg, to determine the optimum ALA dose in terms of both sensitivity and specificity for residual tumor. We will compare residual tumor detection by both in vivo qualitative and quantitative fluorescence imaging using histology of the biopsied tissue as the gold standard.

Secondary

* Assess the correlation between the recorded in vivo qualitative assessment of fluorescence signal from the neurosurgeon with the post-surgical (i.e., ex vivo) absolute PpIX concentration detected both intraoperatively and in ex vivo tissue biopsies.

Tertiary

* To determine the association between the presence of fluorescence in the surgical cavity and the post-operative image enhancement on MRI. This includes the relationship between the amount and location of residual tumor detected by fluorescence, PpIX concentration, and intra-operative frameless stereotaxy following maximal resection versus the amount and location of tumor imaged post-operatively via CT and/or MRI.

OUTLINE: This study will enroll evaluable participants undergoing surgical resection of malignant, grade IV gliomas in both of two groups: those with , newly diagnosed GBM and those with recurrent GBM. Participants in each group (primary vs recurrent GBM) will be randomized to one of 2 levels of ALA dose (10 and20 mg/kg) to be given orally at 6 hours prior to anticipated midpoint of surgery.

Participants who have consented to this protocol will be randomly assigned to one of two ALA dose groups. Randomization will be stratified by whether the tumor is newly diagnosed (i.e. de novo) or recurrent. The data center will prepare sealed, opaque envelopes with the randomized assignment to ALA dose and administration time and notify the pharmacy of the trial site so that so that the correct ALA dose can be prepared.

* Arm I: Newly diagnosed GBM participants receive oral aminolevulinic acid(10mg/kg)at 6 hours before the midpoint of surgery.
* Arm II: Newly diagnosed GBM participants receive oral aminolevulinic acid (20mg/kg)at 6 hours before the midpoint of surgery.
* Arm III: Recurrent GBM participants receive oral aminolevulinic acid (10mg/kg)at 6 hours before the midpoint of surgery.
* Arm IV: Recurrent GBM participants receive oral aminolevulinic acid (20mg/kg)at 6 hours before the midpoint of surgery.

For both participants with new and recurrent disease, biopsies will be taken at up to six sites identified by the surgeon: in the tumor center, tumor edge, area surrounding the tumor (if safe), areas seen to fluoresce intraoperatively and an area with MR enhancement outside the tumor region (if this can be accomplished safely). Prior to collecting these biopsies readings will be taken at the biopsied location with the PpIX point probe by the surgeon. For each of the 6 biopsies, they will be divided into 3 parts and distributed for further analysis as follows: one portion will be sent to the pathologist for assessment of tumor percentage, one portion will be evaluated by the Division of Biophysics at the University of Toronto for PpIX concentration and the other for assessment of fluorescence.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00752323,imaging; surgery,Adult,Primary,Surgery

NCT00693095,Evaluation of Recovery From Drug-Induced Lymphopenia Using Cytomegalovirus-specific T-cell Adoptive Transfer,COMPLETED,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,23,ACTUAL,"Gordana Vlahovic, MD (Duke University)",2008-09,2015-04,2013-12,John Sampson,,Glioblastoma,CMV-ALT + CMV-DCs; CMV-ALT + Saline,18 years,,ALL,"The purpose of this research study is to learn if your own immune cells can be activated and multiplied in order to help your body fight off the tumor cells in your brain. The safety of this procedure will also be studied. This procedure, called CMV-autologous lymphocyte transfer or CMV-ALT is investigational which means that it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is still being tested in research studies. Autologous lymphocyte transfer or ALT means that you will receive your own immune cells back (and not from another donor) as a treatment after they have been activated and grown to large numbers in a clinical lab.

It is believed that the body's immune (protection) system can attack tumor cells and kill them. Immune cells called T-lymphocytes (T-cells) can recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors as a signal to attack and fight the cancer. In most patients with advanced cancer, the immune system does not adequately destroy the tumor because the white blood cells or T-cells are not stimulated enough.

Before your T-cells can become active against tumor cells, they require strong stimulation. There are special ""stimulator"" cells in the body called Dendritic Cells (DCs) that can take up proteins released from cancer cells and present pieces of these proteins to T lymphocytes to create this strong stimulation. Dendritic cells taken from your blood will be ""pulsed"" or loaded with genetic material called RNA (ribonucleic acid), which stimulates the DC to change the RNA into a protein called pp65. This protein is produced by a common virus called Cytomegalovirus (CMV) that 70-80% of us have been exposed to in our lifetime. Recently, we have found that this virus is present in many malignant brain tumors. Brain tumors are very aggressive and, for reasons we do not yet understand, are difficult for the body to attack. The CMV virus is a target in the tumor that, if attacked by your immune systems cells, may prevent your tumor from growing. We have found that we can grow immune cells to very large numbers from the blood of people who have evidence of prior exposure to this virus. You will therefore be tested to determine if you have pre-existing antibodies to this virus in order to participate in this study.

We will use your DCs to activate and grow immune cells from your blood to large numbers in a clinical laboratory. These CMV-specific immune cells, called CMV-ALT, will be returned to your body when they have become activated. It is hoped that these cells will seek out and kill tumor cells that express the CMV viral protein and not attack normal cells. The transfer of immune cells that stimulates your immune system is called adoptive immunotherapy. We will evaluate two doses of immune cells in this study (Dose 1 and Dose 2). Depending on when you are enrolled in this study you will receive either Dose 1 or 2. The first six patients enrolled on this study will receive Dose 1 (the lower dose) and the next six patients will receive Dose 2 (the higher dose). We do not know at this time if either dose is more effective or safer to administer which is why we are testing both doses. Dose 2 will be a larger number of immune cells if the treatment is found to be safe in the first six patients treated during this study.

In this study we will also see, in some randomly selected patients, if giving an injection of the DC pulsed with pp65 RNA into the skin improves the function of the CMV-ALT treatment or not. You will receive three injections under the skin of either some of the same DC that were used to stimulate your immune cells in the clinical laboratory or three injections of saline (salt solution) under the skin starting with the infusion of the CMV-ALT. It is unknown if a DC injection will be beneficial to the immune cells or not so the responses will be compared in patients who receive DC versus saline injection with their CMV-ALT. After these three injections, blood will be collected to compare the responses between patients that received saline to those that received DC injections.","Six CMV seropositive patients with newly-diagnosed GBM will be randomized to receive CMV-ALT (3 x 107/Kg) with or without vaccine with CMV-DCs (2 x 107). All patients will undergo a leukapheresis after resection for harvest of PBLs for CMV-ALT and CMV-DC generation. Patients will then receive RT and concurrent TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m2/d. Patients with histologically or clinically-proven progressive disease during radiation, dependent on steroid supplements above physiologic levels at time of vaccination, and are unable to tolerate TMZ will be replaced. If sufficient CMV-specific T-cells can't be expanded or ALT doesn't meet release criteria, the patient will be replaced and their cells may be used to offer them another DC vaccination study, such as ATTAC Pro00003877. Remaining patients will then receive the initial cycle of TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 200mg/m2/d for 5 days 3 + 1 weeks after completing RT and will be randomized to receive CMV-DCs or saline simultaneous with CMV-ALT as vaccine #1. While the standard targeted dose of 200mg/m2/d for 5 days TMZ treatment is recommended, TMZ regimen may be adjusted at the discretion of the treating neuro-oncologist. Patients with MRI changes consistent with pseudoprogression who continue on TMZ will receive CMV-ALT with vaccinations as scheduled. Peripheral blood will be drawn at 0 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week post vaccine #1 for T-cell kinetics. DCs or saline will be given intradermally and divided equally to both inguinal regions. Vaccines #2 and #3 will occur at 2 week intervals. All patients will then undergo leukapheresis again for immunologic monitoring with specific assessment of baseline antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses.

If the initial dose of CMV-ALT is safe and the combination of CMV-DCs is safe and does not produce an inferior CMV pp65-specific immune response, a 3rd cohort of patients will be enrolled and receive a higher dose of CMV-ALT (3 x 108/Kg) along with vaccine with CMV-DCs (2 x 107). If the combination is unsafe or inferior only the CMV-ALT will be given. If CMV-ALT (3 x 108/Kg) is safe a 4th cohort of 3 patients will be enrolled and receive the same treatment as the 3rd cohort except the T-cells will be labeled with 111In and cultured ex vivo with 13C-glucose and their proliferation, persistence, and migration followed by peripheral blood sampling, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT ), and MRI.

After the initial 3 vaccines, patients will then receive subsequent TMZ cycles every 4 weeks for at least 6 cycles and up to 12 cycles after RT. TMZ will be given on days 1-5 of a 28 day cycle. Patients will then be imaged bimonthly and followed until death. This study will be halted if any 2 patients in any cohort of 3 experience a drug-related Grade IV or irreversible Grade III toxicity.

As part of standard care for these patients, upon tumor progression, participants may undergo stereotactic biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure consent will be obtained separately. However, if tissue is obtained, it will be used to confirm tumor progression histologically and to assess immunologic cell infiltration and pp65 antigen escape at the tumor site. Patients consenting to biopsy or resection will also be offered intratumoral vaccination with CMVpp65 LAMP-loaded, 111In-labeled DCs at the time of surgery to determine if they migrate to cervical lymph nodes.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00693095,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

A tissue biopsy of the area infused will be recommended 5 weeks (± 1 week) after the 2nd lerapolturev infusion via CED, if imaging changes suggest tumor progression vs. immune effect on the MRI obtained 4-5 weeks after the 2nd lerapolturev infusion via CED.

Stage 2 is a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of two treatment regimens for recurrent GBM patients who undergo maximal safe resection for their recurrence.

Study aims are to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the exercise program on progression free survival. Secondary outcomes of interest include cognition, fatigue, and quality of life.","Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant glioma in adults, with a very poor prognosis, limited new treatment options, and neurological sequelae, including physical and cognitive decline that adversely affect quality of life (QOL). Physical activity may be an intervention that attenuates the cognitive and physical decline associated with GBM. However, few studies examine physical activity in brain tumor patients, perhaps due to challenges in trial design, measuring outcomes, and complexity of care. Aims of this work are to develop and implement an individualized exercise intervention for GBM patients to support functional independence, and to delay tumor progression and cognitive decline. Methods: GBM patients scheduled to be treated with concurrent radiation and chemotherapy will be recruited from the neuro-oncology clinic at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Participants will receive an individualized, home-based exercise program that includes aerobic and resistance training, tailored to prior level of fitness, current physical status, and individual interests. They will undergo 1-hr standardized, validated assessments of physical and neurocognitive functions, mood, fatigue, and QOL, prior to radiation, and then 3, 6, 12, and 18 months later. Significance: Identifying interventions that preserve or improve mobility and cognitive function will enhance QOL and may lengthen progression-free survival in brain tumor patients. Moreover, finding ways to help patients maintain self-care will lessen the strain on the health care system (e.g., fewer hospitalizations, delayed utilization of palliative care hospice).",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03390569,chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

The majority of GBM cells display damaged mitochondria (the ""batteries"" of cells), so they rely on an alternate method for producing energy called the Warburg Effect, which relies nearly exclusively on glucose (in contrast, normal cells can use other molecules, such as fatty acids and fat-derived ketones, for energy). Metabolic interventions, such as fasting and ketogenic diets, target cancer cell metabolism by enhancing mitochondria function, decreasing blood glucose levels, and increasing blood ketone levels, creating an advantage for normal cells but a disadvantage for cancer cells. Preliminary experience at Waikato Hospital has shown that a metabolic therapy program (MTP) utilizing fasting and ketogenic diets is feasible and safe in people with advanced cancer, and may provide a therapeutic benefit. We aim to determine whether using an MTP concurrently with standard oncological treatment (chemoradiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy) is feasible and safe in patients with GBM, and has treatment outcomes consistent with greater overall treatment efficacy than in published trials.","Gliomas are tumours that originate from glial cells in the central nervous system. The most common histological subtype is GBM, which accounts for nearly 50% of all malignant brain tumours. Despite aggressive multimodal treatment, the median survival for GBM is poor (8-15 months).

Although cancer is regarded as a genetic disease, it may be perceived as a metabolic disorder. The majority of human cancers, including GBM, display low numbers of mitochondria, most of which are structurally damaged, resulting in defective cell respiration. To compensate, cancer cells greatly increase their uptake of glucose, which is fermented (regardless of oxygen concentration, a process known as the Warburg Effect) to generate energy. Cancer cells also rely on increased growth signaling pathways involving insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and mammalian target of rapamycin to support their unbridled growth and proliferation. Cancer cells may therefore be vulnerable to interventions that selectively target their abnormal metabolism.

Metabolic interventions, such as fasting and ketogenic diets, target cancer cell metabolism and may be effective alongside standard treatments in advanced cancers. Fasting is a voluntary abstinence from food and drink for a controlled period of time (typically, 12 hours to 3 weeks in humans), whereas ketogenic diets are high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diets that stimulate the body to create a fasting-like metabolic state. Fasting and ketogenic diets stimulate mitochondria biogenesis, decrease blood glucose, increase liver production of fat-derived ketones (which serve as a major alternative energy source for most normal cells within the body, but cannot be utilized by cancer cells), and decrease growth factor availability. Thus, fasting and ketogenic diets provide an advantage for normal cells but a disadvantage to cancer cells by enhancing mitochondria biogenesis and function, depriving cancer cells of their major fuel, and creating a cell environment unfavourable for unbridled growth and proliferation.

Preliminary experience at Waikato Hospital has shown that a metabolic therapy program (MTP) consisting of fasting and/or a ketogenic diet is feasible, safe, and may be effective in patients with advanced cancer, including GBM. In a recent case report, a metabolic strategy (7-day fast every 1-2 months, with a ketogenic diet between fasts) resulted in the near-complete regression of a stage IVA metastatic thymoma after 2 years. Moreover, we are currently observing 8 glioblastoma patients who voluntarily consented to undergo fasting and ketogenic diet therapy in a manner similar to what we propose to use in this study; at an average of 4-5 months, all patients have completed the fasts and adhered to their ketogenic diet, experiencing only mild adverse effects.

On this background, we aim to determine whether using an MTP concurrently with standard oncological treatment (chemoradiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy) is feasible and safe, and has treatment outcomes consistent with greater overall treatment efficacy than in published trials, in patients with GBM.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04730869,chemotherapy,Adult,Metastatic,Post-Surgery

NCT02903069,"Phase 1b, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of Marizomib With Temozolomide and Radiotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed WHO Grade IV Malignant Glioma",COMPLETED,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,66,ACTUAL,,8/17/2016,1/25/2021,1/25/2021,Celgene,Triphase Research and Development III Corp.,Glioblastoma; Malignant Glioma,MRZ; TMZ; RT; Optune,18 years,,ALL,"This study is for newly diagnosed WHO Grade IV malignant glioma patients to determine whether an investigational drug known as marizomib (MRZ) will improve the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients by delaying the growth of the cancer, reducing the size of the tumor, and/or improving survival. Marizomib (MRZ) is being added to standard-of-care treatments of radiotherapy (RT), temozolomide (TMZ), and Optune.","Gliomas account for \~80% of primary malignant tumors in the Central Nervous System (CNS), with WHO Grade IV malignant glioma (G4 MG; including glioblastoma and gliosarcoma) constituting the majority of gliomas, and are essentially incurable. Currently only surgical resection and radiotherapy (RT) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) are standard-of-care treatment strategies for newly diagnosed G4 MG. However, resistance to chemotherapy and RT results in a high recurrence rate, with median survival of \~15-16 months. Since no survival advantage has been demonstrated for the addition of bevacizumab (BEV) to TMZ and RT (Chinot 2014) in newly diagnosed G4 MG, alternative promising investigational agents need to be tested.

Targeting the proteasome is a well-validated target for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), and preclinical evidence suggests that targeting the proteasome in glioma cells shows significant anti-tumor activity. Proteasome activity is elevated in patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) tissue in comparison with normal human brain. Importantly, preclinical evidence demonstrates that proteasome inhibition sensitizes GBM cell lines to irradiation and to TMZ. Further, the combination of bortezomib (BTZ, one of three proteasome inhibitors \[PI\] currently approved for the treatment of MM) with TMZ resulted in synergistic glioblastoma cell death in vitro, and BTZ reduces glioma cell survival in vitro in cell lines sensitive and resistant to TMZ.

Despite the activity against GBM cells in vitro, BTZ does not cross the blood brain barrier, and thus has proven ineffective in animal models and in the clinic. In contrast, marizomib (MRZ) - a potent and irreversible 20S PI possesses the unique attribute among PIs to cross the blood brain barrier as shown in previous clinical studies. These data prompted examination of the combination of MRZ and BEV in an ongoing clinical trial in patients with recurrent G4 MG. In the dose-escalation portion of this ongoing study (MRZ-108), 12 patients were dosed with MRZ once weekly for 3 weeks (0.55, 0.7, and 0.8 mg/m2 infused intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes) and with BEV on weeks 1 and 3 (10 mg/kg IV) of a 28-day cycle. As of April 2016, of these 12 patients, 7 were on study for over 4 months - 5 with a partial response (including 2 patients with no radiologic evidence of tumor on 2 or more consecutive MRI scans) and 2 patients whose best response was stable disease. Four of these 12 patients were treated for over 6 months, 3 of whom remain on study. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MRZ was determined to be 0.8 mg/m2. Currently, an expansion cohort of 24 patients has been enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study. The next phase involves treatment with MRZ alone (no BEV) in patients with recurrent G4 MG, and has begun enrolling patients in the second quarter of 2016.

Together, the demonstrated activity of PIs in preclinical glioma models, and the synergistic activity of PIs with TMZ on glioblastoma cells, along with the ability of MRZ to access the CNS, provides compelling rationale to assess the therapeutic benefit of the combination of MRZ with TMZ in patients with G4 MG, for whom no brain-penetrant options for proteasome inhibition are currently available.

Very recently, the FDA has approved a novel treatment device using tumor treating fields (Optune) in addition to standard of care RTand TMZ as an option to standard of care. Optune has been shown to significantly improve both progression-free and overall survival in GBM patients. An additional cohort of 12 patients will be treated with Optune in combination with MRZ and TMZ In North America, the Optune arm is offered only for the US trial sites, and is not offered for the Canadian trial sites.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02903069,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

There are currently few cases published involving the use of PDT in infratentorial (in the posterior fossa) brain tumors in general and specifically those occurring in children. The investigators propose to test a technique, for the first time in the U.S., that demonstrated in Australian adult glioblastoma patients dramatic long-term, survival rates of 57% (anaplastic astrocytoma) and 37% (glioblastoma multiforme). These results are unprecedented in any other treatment protocol.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a paradigm shift in the treatment of tumors from the traditional resection and systemic chemotherapy methods. The principle behind photodynamic therapy is light-mediated activation of a photosensitizer that is selectively accumulated in the target tissue, causing tumor cell destruction through singlet oxygen production. Therefore, the photosensitizer is considered to be the first critical element in PDT procedures, and the activation procedure is the second step. The methodology used in this proposal utilizes more intensive laser light and larger Photofrin photosensitizer doses than prior PDT protocols in the U.S. for brain tumor patients. The PDT will consist of photoillumination at 630 nm beginning at the center of the tumor resection cavity, and delivering a total energy of 240 J cm-2. The investigators feel that the light should penetrate far enough into the tissue to reach migrating tumor cells, and destroy these cells without harming the healthy cells in which they are dispersed.

The investigators will be testing the hypothesis that pediatric subjects with progressive/recurrent malignant brain tumors undergoing PDT with increased doses of Photofrin® and light energy than were used in our previous clinical study will show better progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes. PDT will also be effective against infratentorial tumors.

STUDY HYPOTHESIS: The blood-brain barrier can be safely opened using pulsed ultrasound prior to chemotherapy administration in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Transient opening of the blood-brain barrier by pulsed ultrasound will increase the glioblastoma exposure to carboplatin-based chemotherapy and increase progression-free and overall survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.","For patients with recurrent malignant gliomas, who have already been treated by a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, few treatment options currently exist. Salvage therapies typically consist of systemic administration of chemotherapy agents, which have been shown to have limited effectiveness as median survival in this patient group is currently only 6 months.

One limitation to the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of brain tumors is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To enhance the delivery of systemically administered chemotherapy agents to brain tumors, an implantable ultrasound device was developed that can be used to temporarily disrupt the BBB. Delivery of pulsed ultrasound, in combination with an ultrasound contrast agent, has been shown to temporarily disrupt the BBB for a duration of more than 6 hours and allow for a significantly increased penetration of systemically administered chemotherapy drugs in pre-clinical studies.

This study will evaluate the safety of temporary disruption of the BBB during carboplatin chemotherapy delivery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. This study will also evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of ultrasound that can be used to disrupt the BBB.

The use of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI will be evaluated for determining the extent and magnitude of BBB opening.

Clinical trials that utilize DCs for immunotherapy have demonstrated significant survival benefit for patients who exhibit robust immune responses against tumor cells. Unfortunately, at the present time the majority of tumor patients are unable to mount an adequate immune response and thus succumb to their tumors. We postulate that the inability to generate an appropriate immune response in these patients is due to a lack of sufficient numbers of appropriate T cells due to an inadequate source of tumor antigens.","Autologous DCs will be obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each patient by leukapheresis. An established BTSC line will be used as an allogeneic source of tumor antigen. Approximately 4 weeks will be required after the leukapheresis for vaccine production and the first vaccine administration.

Each patient will receive an injection of DCs at his/her assigned dose once every 2 weeks during the first 8 weeks, followed by injections every 4 weeks for an additional 10 vaccinations. Imiquimod will be applied to the vaccination site just prior to and 24 hours after each vaccine administration.

This study will use an accelerated dose escalation design (1 subject per level) until dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is encountered, after which a traditional phase I design (3 subjects per level) will be implemented. DLT is defined as grade 3 or greater treatment related toxicity.

This physical barrier is located at the level of the blood vessel walls. Because of these barrier properties, the blood vessels are also impermeable to the passage of therapeutic molecules from the blood to the brain.

...","Background

* Children and young adults diagnosed with a high-grade or high-risk cancer (e.g., diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, relapsed-refractory leukemia, refractory metastatic sarcomas) face a poor prognosis given limited curative options.
* Recent research has indicated that this population of patients and their parents experience elevated stress and poorer health-related quality of life (HRQL) relative to normative samples.
* Recently published psychosocial standards of care in pediatric oncology strongly recommend that children diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers receive early and continued assessment of their wellbeing and have access to interventions to optimize functioning and HRQL. In addition, there is increasing recognition of the importance of palliative interventions early in the disease trajectory.
* Despite this recommendation, minimal research has examined supportive care interventions for this population early in the disease trajectory.
* Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have empirical support for their feasibility and efficacy in alleviating emotional distress and physical symptoms in children and adults with chronic health conditions, including terminally-ill patients and their caregivers.

Objectives

-To assess the feasibility of an enhanced mindfulness intervention (EMI) in children and young adults (ages 5-24 years) with a high-grade or high-risk cancer with poor prognosis and one of their primary caregivers.

Eligibility

* Children and young adults ages 5-24 years and a parent or adult primary caregiver
* Diagnosis of a high-grade or high-risk cancer with poor prognosis
* English speaking
* Must have access to a mobile device or computer with internet.
* Potential participants will be excluded if there is evidence of pre-morbid severe cognitive or psychiatric disability in parent or child that would impair their capacity for participation, or if there is evidence of clinical disease progression at the time of referral to this study, such that it would prevent the child from engaging in the intervention.

Design

* This is a pilot randomized controlled trial that will compare feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an 8-week enhanced mindfulness intervention (EMI) group (n=10 dyads) compared to a psychoeducation control group (n=10 dyads).
* All participants will complete measures of feasibility (primary outcome) and exploratory outcomes at baseline and following the 8-week intervention. Exploratory measures will include emotional (e.g., depression, anxiety) and physical (e.g., pain, fatigue) wellbeing, as well as baseline mindfulness/self-compassion.
* The 8-week EMI will consist of one initial in-person session with the child and parent, a series of at-home assignments, and two booster sessions. The psychoeducation group will be given educational material about coping with cancer.
* The psychoeducation group will be offered the opportunity to participate in the EMI 8 weeks post-baseline",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03538587,pediatric,Mixed,Metastatic,Unclear

The treatment combines two different approaches to fight cancer: immune modulators and antigen-specific T cells. Immune checkpoint antibodies have been tested on various tumors with good outcomes. GBM is known to express increased levels of certain antigens that can be targeted by T cells including chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cells and tumor antigen specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs). In this study, the gene-modified T cells specific for GBM antigens will be combined with immune modulatory gene-modified dendritic cells (DCs) as individualized treatment regimens to treat patients.","Background:

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most dangerous and aggressive form of brain cancer. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells have been shown to mediate long-term durable remissions in recurrent or refractory hematopoietic malignancies, and thus the CAR-T therapy approach is also considered a promising treatment against GBM. Some surface antigens such as GD2 and CD56 have been targeted as potential GBM antigens. In addition, certain antigens are highly specific in GBM, such as epidermal growth factor receptor variant EGFRviii and metastasis related antigen CD44v6.

Tumor microenvironment is known to suppressive anti-cancer immune responses. Many immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated marked anti-tumor activities. For example, CD276 is a member of the B7 family of immune checkpoint proteins, and CD276-specific CAR-T cell therapy have been considered a potential brain tumor microenvironment treatment. Besides immune checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, antigen-specific T cells modified with immune modulatory genes (IgT) such as genes encoding immune checkpoint inhibitors may be applied. Combination of tumor targeting and immune modulatory activities, the IgT cells could target both the tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03170141,immunotherapy,Mixed,Metastatic,Unclear

Because of the lack of toxicity, there are no restrictions related to performance status or blood tests at the time of treatment. The key endpoint is OS from date of first injection after RT/TMZ; secondary endpoints are PFS from date of first injection, and OS and PFS from date of randomization prior to RT/TMZ. Date of PFS will be determined by the principal investigator at each site.","This is a multi-center, double-blind, 2:1 randomized phase 3 trial to determine whether the addition of AV-GBM-1 to standard therapy increases OS of patients with a recent diagnosis of primary GBM.

Patients will sign two treatment-related consents, one for obtaining fresh tumor tissue at the time of craniotomy for the purpose of establishing a short-term tumor cell line and for awareness of subsequent leukapheresis procedure, and the other for randomization and participation in the randomized trial. As required for related medical procedures, patients will sign medical consents for craniotomy/tumor resection, and for leukapheresis to obtain monocytes for the MC control arm, or to manufacture DC.

Key eligibility criteria are (1) recovered from maximal safe surgical resection surgery from which a short-term cell culture has been established, (2) undergone leukapheresis prior to planned concurrent RT/TMZ, from which a sufficient number of MC have been derived, (3) screened, stratified and randomized prior to starting RT/TMZ. Patients will be stratified by age (70 years or greater or less than 70), KPS (90 or 100 vs 70 or 80), MGMT promotor-methylation (yes or no), and IDH-mutation status (mutated or wild-type), then randomized 2:1 (AV-GBM-1 vs MC control).

The final products will be manufactured while the patient is being treated with RT/TMZ. After recovery from RT/TMZ, one of the study agents, either the DC-ATA AV-GBM-1 or autologous MC control, will be administered weekly for three weeks just prior to starting adjuvant TMZ, and then every four weeks concurrently with, adjuvant TMZ or second-line therapy per managing physician. Both products are admixed with adjuvant 500 mcg of GM-CSF by a local pharmacist, just prior to each injection. The pharmacist, the patient, their health care givers and local research team will be masked as to whether the patient is receiving AV-GBM-1 or MC control, which are similar in appearance. Only the AIVITA manufacturing team will be aware of randomization so that the appropriate product can be manufactured per SOPs.

The first 3 weekly SC injections of study agent will be administered prior to beginning adjuvant or salvage temozolomide, temozolomide plus bevacizumab, or temozolomide plus tumor treating fields. Thereafter study agents will be injected about every 28 days for up to 18 additional vaccines (i.e. a total of 21 vaccines over 18 months from the start of investigational therapy. Depending on the number of study-agent doses available, additional leukaphereses and manufacturing of more study agent may be required if treatment is to continue up to 18 months from the start of therapy. In previous trials, 8 total injections were given over 6 months. In this trial up to 21 doses may be given over 18 months.

In previous trials each patient-specific batch of DC-ATA was divided into 10 aliquots, 8 of which were intended for injection. The range of cells was from 1 to over 30 million per aliquot. However, the clinical trials have consistently suggested that 1 to 2 million cells is a sufficient dose. Therefore, for this trial each patient-specific batch of DC-ATA will be divided into aliquots containing 2 million DC-ATA cells (prior to cryopreservation), and after the initial series of three weekly injections, subsequent injections will be administered up to 18 months from the first injection. If the product is used up, a cryopreserved cell line can be re-expanded and an additional leukapheresis procedure performed in order to make more AV-GBM-1 or MC control, if the patient and their physician wish to continue treatment. For those who were randomized to AV-GBM-1, a GBM cell culture would be re-established from a cryopreserved sample of the original cell line. If for some reason the cell line cannot be reestablished, then patients randomized to the AV-GBM-1 arm would receive injections of their monocytes with GM-CSF to preserve the double-blind conditions.

Patients who are confirmed to have experienced PD while on study must discontinue AV-GBM-1 treatment.

The intent is to enroll approximately 1,120 patients for tumor collection to have 672 patients who are eligible for treatment at the time of randomization and who have granted consent for participation.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties will be explored and tumor responses to treatment will be evaluated.","Malignant gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system tumors found in adults, with WHO Grade IV malignant glioma (GBM) representing the most aggressive and prevalent sub-type of these tumors having one of the worst 5-year survival rates among all human cancers.

Standard therapy for patients with malignant gliomas has traditionally involved maximal surgical resection/debulking of the primary tumor (if feasible), followed by adjuvant radiotherapy over 6-8 weeks, with or without chemotherapy. The oral alkylating agent temozolomide was found to increase median survival when used in combination with radiotherapy, compared to radiotherapy alone, in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. However, expression of O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) in GBM has been linked to poor patient outcome in patients treated with temozolomide.

The study drug, dianhydrogalactitol (VAL 083) is a bi-functional N7 DNA alkylating agent which has demonstrated cytotoxic activity that is independent of chemo-resistance due to expression of MGMT. This makes VAL-083 an ideal candidate to treat patients who are unlikely to respond to temozolomide due to MGMT expression in their GBM. Furthermore, VAL-083 acted as a radio-sensitizer at low (1 - 2.5μM) concentrations in all GBM cultures tested.

VAL-083 has been studied extensively in the United States by the National Cancer Institute. The NCI studies suggested that VAL-083 appeared to have activity in some types of cancer (lung and brain), including GBM; however, further VAL-083 research was not pursued in the US due to an increased focus on targeted biologic therapies during that era. VAL-083 has also been studied in the People's Republic of China, where it is currently approved and marketed for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and lung cancer. At present, VAL-083 is being studied in clinical trials in the United States as a third-line treatment option for patients with recurrent GBM following failure of surgery, radiation therapy, temozolomide and bevacizumab. Interim results support safety of VAL-083 in this population; to date, a regimen of 40mg/m2/d x 3 days IV in a 21 day cycle has been confirmed to be safe and well tolerated.

This phase 2, open-label, single arm study will be conducted in a dose-escalation cohort scheme to confirm the optimal dose of VAL-083, when administered concurrently with radiation therapy. Dose escalation will proceed in three sequential cohorts, consisting of patients receiving VAL-083 at 20, 30 and 40 mg/m2/d x 3 every 21 days.

This trial will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will consist of 1) a 42-day induction period, during which patients will receive VAL-083 while undergoing radiation treatment at a dose of 2 Gy per fraction given once daily five days per week (Monday through Friday) over a period of six weeks (for a total dose of 60 Gy), followed by 2) adjuvant maintenance therapy with VAL-083 alone, administered daily x 3 IV every 3 weeks at the same assigned dose, for a maximum of 8 maintenance cycles. Part 2 will comprise an expansion phase, in which VAL-083 will be studied in up to 20 additional subjects. The dose of VAL-083 that will be studied in Part 2 will be determined from Part 1.

Patients will undergo safety assessments including physical examinations, vital signs, hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis.

In both parts of the study, a pharmacokinetic study may be conducted at treatment Cycle 1 Day 1, in consenting patients. For patients consenting to CSF collection by lumbar puncture, a CSF sample will be obtained after completion of the Cycle 1, Day 3 VAL-083 infusion. These patients will also have a blood sample taken for VAL-083 plasma level after completion of drug infusion.

There are two parts to this study. Part A: dose escalation, and Part B: dose expansion.

Part A:

The investigators will investigate the combination of a fixed dose of atezolizumab (1200mg) in combination with escalating doses of ipatasertib in patients with advanced solid tumours (Cohort A1) and patients with resectable glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Cohort A2).

Cohort A1 (advanced solid tumours):

There will be an ipatasertib run-in phase of 14 days of continuous oral dosing with paired pre and post-treatment blood and tissue samples. Combinations dosing will commence on Cycle 1 Day 1 with the atezolizumab infusion. Cycle 1 will therefore be 35 days. Only patients with advanced solid tumours recruited into Cohort A1 will be included in dose escalation decisions and determination of the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for part B.

Cohort A2 (potentially resectable GBMs):

There will be an ipatasertib run-in phase of at least 14 days and up to 21 days followed by surgical resection of the patient's tumour (5 day window for surgery). Ipatasertib dosing will be stopped 48 hours prior to surgery and combination dosing on Cycle1Day1 (C1D1) will commence after recovery. Accrual to Cohort A2 will run in parallel Cohort A1 without formal dose escalations and patients in Cohort A2 will not be included in dose escalation decisions for Cohort A1.

Recruitment to Part A is complete.

Part B:

Patients will be enrolled into the expansion phase (Part B) to further characterize the tolerability of the RP2D (established in Cohort A1) of the combination in specific subgroups of patients. Part B of the study will have a pre-screening component for patients with solid tumours (Cohorts B1 and B2) to allow for enrichment for these specific subgroups of patients.

Part B of the study will have three cohorts:

* Cohort B1: patients with solid tumours with hyperactivation of PI3K pathway as determined by pathogenic mutations identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) (eg known activating mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1, AKT2) or PTEN loss (assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (n=12).
* Cohort B2: patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with PTEN loss as assessed by IHC (n=12)
* Cohort B3: patients with glioblastoma (n=12) of which at least three (n=3) patients will have potentially resectable recurrent glioblastomas. Recruitment to cohort B3 is complete.
* Cohort B4: patients with melanoma post progression on immune-checkpoint inhibitors (n=12)
* Cohort B5: patients with other tumour types refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors (where immune checkpoint inhibitors are licensed, e.g. bladder cancer, head and neck SCC, NSCLC) (n=12)

Oral NFV is a standard therapy for patients with HIV and the safety of 1250 mg BID NFV is well-established. Case studies have also reported that HIV patients have received radiotherapy for cancer, while on 1250 mg BID NFV. This is the first trial of oral NFV and chemoradiotherapy for GBM patients. Although unacceptable toxicity is unlikely, two NFV dose levels (625, and 1250 mg BID) will be evaluated in a cohort escalation design of 3-6 subjects. At the MTD, 19 additional subjects will be enrolled to generate pilot data on radiographic response and to evaluate further toxicity. A maximum of 31 subjects will be enrolled on the trial.","Current therapy for GBM GBM is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Prior to the introduction of temozolomide, the median survival was generally less than one year from the time of diagnosis. Standard therapy had consisted of surgical resection to the extent safely feasible, followed by radiotherapy. Adjuvant carmustine, a nitrosourea drug, was commonly prescribed in the United States. Cooperative-group trials had investigated the addition of various chemotherapeutic regimens to radiotherapy but no randomized phase 3 trial of nitrosourea-based adjuvant chemotherapy had demonstrated a significant survival benefit as compared with radiotherapy alone. A metaanalysis based on randomized trials suggested a small survival benefit of chemotherapy, as compared with Template Version: 7 May 2008 IRB APPLICATION page 1 of 8 radiotherapy alone (a 5 percent increase in survival at two years, from 15 percent to 20 percent). To further improve on these survival rates, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Brain Tumor and Radiotherapy Groups, and the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group completed a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial to compare the alkylating agent temozolomide and radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. \[1\] A total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization. At a median follow-up of 28 months, the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P0.001 by the log-rank test). The two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 10.4 percent with radiotherapy alone. Concomitant treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects in only 7 percent of patients.

Due to this landmark study, GBM patients who have a good performance status are now typically treated with concurrent radiation and temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide. However, this standard therapy still only results in a median survival of about 14.6 months and a progression-free survival of about 6.9 months. Given these low survival rates, new approaches are needed. The addition of a molecularly-targeted therapy to the standard treatment is an approach that merits further investigation.

GBM, Molecular Markers, and Radiosensitization In GBM, PTEN mutations occur in about a third of patients while EGFR or EGFRvIII (truncated EGFR) amplification occurs in up to 40% of patients. These changes have been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis. Over the past decade EGFR and Ras have been shown to modulate tumor radiosensitivity. EGFR has a number of downstream effectors that include Ras and PI3K. EGFR and Ras-mediated radioresistance is mediated, at least in part by PI3K, and phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) is a good marker for this effect . We have previously shown in head and neck cancer that P-Akt is a good predictor of clinical response to radiation. We and others have shown that blocking PI3K-Akt pathway enhances radiation response in vitro and in vivo. Radiosensitization occurs in cells in which this pathway is constitutively activated but does not occur in cells (such as normal tissues) in which this pathway is not activated. Inhibition of this pathway, therefore, is a promising approach for radiation sensitization. One difficulty in implementing this therapeutic strategy has been obtaining the means to block this deregulated signaling pathway in patients.

We have found that one class of commonly used drugs, the HIV protease inhibitors (HPIs) interfere with PI3K-Akt signaling. These drugs given in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors are the mainstay of the current therapeutic regimens for HIV infected patients. The HPIs are peptidomimetics that inhibit the HIV aspartyl protease, a retroviral enzyme that cleaves the viral gag-pol polyprotein and is necessary for the production of infectious viral particles. One prominent side effect of HPI treatment is insulin resistance. Since Akt, plays a key role in the coordinated regulation of growth and metabolism by the insulin/IGFsignaling pathway, we explored the possibility that HPIs might block the PI3K-Akt signaling axis in tumor cells and hence might be used clinically as radiation sensitizers. We tested NFV and found that it inhibited Akt at concentrations that are routinely achieved in patients. NFV also sensitized tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo to radiation. HPIs have been used continuously in patients with well-characterized pharmacokinetics. There are reports of HIV patients on protease inhibitors who have received radiation therapy; no increase in side effects from the radiation have been reported and clinical outcome may be improved.

In summary, there is clearly strong rationale to proceed with a clinical trial of NFV and chemoradiation in GBM:

1. The prognosis in GBM patients is poor with median survival of 14.6 months with best therapy.
2. Preclinical work demonstrates NFV results in down regulation of Akt signaling in cancer cells and results in radiation sensitization.
3. There is a high frequency of Akt activation in GBM, which has been linked to the pathogenesis and maintenance of the tumor.
4. NFV has been shown to be distributed brain tissue while on therapy and is likely to have increased brain penetrance during fractionated radiotherapy when disruption of the blood-brain-barrier may occur.

They are the second leading cause of cancer mortality in people under the age of 35 and the fourth leading cause in those under the age of 54. Standard therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) includes surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Despite optimal treatment the prognosis remains poor. Patients with GBM have a median survival of approximately 10-15 months. Essentially all patients suffer recurrent disease, usually within 8 months of diagnosis. For patients with malignant glioma whose tumors recur, the median time to tumor progression is 9-13 weeks with the current standard of treatment for recurrent glioblastoma, bevacizumab (AVASTIN®). There is an urgent need for more effective therapies.

GBM cancer cells depend on glucose for energy supply and survival. When glucose levels are reduced, normal brain cells metabolize ketone bodies for energy. Brain tumor cells cannot do so. This makes the tumor cells vulnerable to death using therapies that target glucose metabolism. In brain cancer patients, high blood glucose levels are associated with reduced survival. In mice, reduction in circulating glucose levels through ketogenic diet (KD) reduces tumor growth

Ketogenic diet (KD) reduces blood glucose levels while elevating levels of ketone bodies, and may thus be beneficial in the treatment of GBM as a non-toxic metabolic therapy. KD is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet used for treatment of refractory seizures. There have been two case reports of KD use in patients with GBM showing slowing of tumor progression.

Ketogenic diet (KD) is a high fat, low protein, low carbohydrate diet that is an effective treatment of refractory epilepsy in children. The diet consists of long chain saturated triglycerides with a 3:1 or 4:1 \[fat\] : \[protein + carbohydrate\] ratio by weight, with 87-90% of calories derived from fat. The investigators have recently evaluated KD with caloric restriction of 1600 kcal /day in adults with refractory epilepsy. The diet was well tolerated. Side effects included mild nausea (n=2), mild diarrhea (n= 2), and mild constipation (n=2). No subjects stopped treatment because of side effects. Mild transient hunger was experienced by 3 subjects but there was no clinically significant hunger.

The goal of the present study is to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of 4:1 KD in a small number of patients with GBM progressing or recurring after standard treatment of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy with temozolamide and, after further rescue threrapy with bevacizumab (AVASTIN®), as the first step in evaluation of therapeutic potential of KD in the treatment of GBM. This will be a small, open label pilot study. 6 patients with GBM recurring or progressing after surgery, radiation and chemotherapy (temazolamide) and after further rescue treatment with bevacizumab will be treated with 4:1 \[fat\]:\[protein+carbohydrate\] ratio, 1600 kcal/day diet. Survival, time to steroid rescue treatment and progression free survival will be compared to historical controls with life expectancy of ≤ 3 months.

The diet (KD) will consist of pre-made meals, including breakfast, lunch, dinner and two snacks, one each between breakfast and lunch and lunch and dinner, with a 2 week-long meal plan consisting of different recipes for each day of the month, with repeating 2-week-long cycles. The diet will be supplemented with vitamins, calcium and phosphorus supplements to meet the requirements of US Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) standard. Treatment will last 6 months. Primary aims of the study will be to (1) obtain pilot data on efficacy of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of treatment-refractory glioblastoma multiforme, (2) evaluate the safety of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of treatment-refractory glioblastoma multiforme, and (3) evaluate tolerability of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of treatment-refractory glioblastoma multiforme.

Despite this terrible and frustrating outcome, continued treatment of this population remains fundamental to improving cure rates. Studying this relapsed population will help unearth clues to why conventional therapy fails and how cancers continue to resist modern advances. Moreover, improvements in the treatment of this relapsed population will lead to improvements in upfront therapy and reduce the chance of relapse for all. Novel therapy and, more importantly, novel approaches are sorely needed. This trial proposes a new approach that evaluates rational combination therapies of novel agents based on tumor type and molecular characteristics of these diseases. The investigators hypothesize that the use of two predictably active drugs (a doublet) will increase the chance of clinical efficacy. The purpose of this trial is to perform a limited dose escalation study of multiple doublets to evaluate the safety and tolerability of these combinations followed by a small expansion cohort to detect preliminary efficacy. In addition, a more extensive and robust molecular analysis of all the participant samples will be performed as part of the trial such that we can refine the molecular classification and better inform on potential response to therapy. In this manner the tolerability of combinations can be evaluated on a small but relevant population and the chance of detecting antitumor activity is potentially increased. Furthermore, the goal of the complementary molecular characterization will be to eventually match the therapy with better predictive biomarkers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the safety and tolerability and estimate the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of combination treatment by stratum.
* To characterize the pharmacokinetics of combination treatment by stratum.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

* To estimate the rate and duration of objective response and progression free survival (PFS) by stratum.","Patients will be stratified by the molecular and histologic characteristics of their tumor to one of three treatment strata.

STRATUM A:

* Combination Treatment: ribociclib and gemcitabine.

Mebendazole is a drug used to treat infections with intestinal parasites and has a long track record of safety in humans. Recently, it was discovered that mebendazole may be effective in treating cancer as well, in particular brain tumors. Studies using both cell cultures and mouse models demonstrated that mebendazole was effective in decreasing the growth of brain tumor cells.

This study focuses on the treatment of a category of brain tumors called gliomas. Low-grade gliomas are tumors arising from the glial cells of the central nervous system and are characterized by slower, less aggressive growth than that of high-grade gliomas. Some low-grade gliomas have a more aggressive biology and an increased likelihood of resistance or recurrence.

Low-grade gliomas are often able to be treated by observation alone if they receive a total surgical resection. However, tumors which are only partially resected and continue to grow or cause symptoms, or those which recur following total resection require additional treatment, such as chemotherapy. Due to their more aggressive nature, pilomyxoid astrocytomas, even when totally resected, will often be treated with chemotherapy. The current first-line treatment at our institution for these low-grade gliomas involves a three-drug chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, carboplatin, and temozolomide. However, based on our data from our own historical controls, over 50% of patients with pilomyxoid astrocytomas will continue to have disease progression while on this treatment. We believe that mebendazole in combination with vincristine, carboplatin, and temozolomide may provide an additional therapeutic benefit with increased progression-free and overall survival for low-grade glioma patients, particularly for those with pilomyxoid astrocytomas.

High grade gliomas are more aggressive tumors with poor prognoses. The standard therapy is radiation therapy. A variety of adjuvant chemotherapeutic combinations have been used, but with disappointing results. For high-grade gliomas this study will add mebendazole to the established combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan to determine this combinations safety and efficacy","This is a phase I/II study of mebendazole in combination with standard of care agents for pediatric patients with gliomas. Patients with low-grade gliomas will receive a regimen of mebendazole in combination with vincristine, carboplatin, and temozolomide. Patients with high-grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas will receive a regimen of mebendazole in combination with bevacizumab and irinotecan. Surgical resection of the tumor will be attempted initially with the goal of achieving a gross total resection without substantial neurologic deficit. Subtotal resection may be preferable depending on the location of the tumor. Optic pathway gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas may remain unresected. Patients with high-grade gliomas or diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas will undergo local irradiation of their tumor before beginning protocol treatment. Low-grade glioma patients will not receive radiation therapy. Patients who have been previously treated with chemotherapy will be eligible for the study provided they have not previously failed therapy with any of the chemotherapeutic agents.

Patients with eligible tumors will be consented for enrollment into the study. The study patients will be divided into two groups (low-grade glioma and high-grade/pontine glioma) for the purpose of determining the maximally tolerated dose of mebendazole. These two groups will be treated independently with regard to patient accrual, dose escalation, and evaluation of toxicity. In addition to their standard chemotherapy regimen, patients in both cohorts will receive mebendazole. Mebendazole doses will be escalated from the initial dose level of 50 mg/kg/day divided twice daily, to a second dose level of 100 mg/kg/day divided twice daily, to the final dose level of 200 mg/kg/day divided twice daily, in cohorts of three patients per dose level. A standard ""3+3"" design will be used for determining dose escalation.

Phase I safety monitoring for the low-grade group will take place during a trial period beginning with start of therapy and ending following the tenth week of induction therapy. Phase I safety monitoring for the high-grade/pontine glioma group will take place during a trial period beginning with the start of maintenance therapy through the twelfth week of maintenance therapy (3 cycles).

After determination of maximally tolerated dose for each group, the study will continue to evaluate efficacy of this regimen. The study will be amended for the maximally tolerated dose for each group to be used in the remainder of the study. Patients currently on study will continue with maintenance therapy. To document the degree of residual tumor, standard whole brain MRI with and without contrast (gadolinium) will be performed following a specified intervals. Following completion of therapy, patients will continue to be monitored by MRI to assess progression-free and overall-survival.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01837862,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; pediatric,Mixed,Unclear,Post-Surgery

There are three phases of treatment in this study: the Chemo-radiation Phase, the Adjuvant Phase, and the Follow-Up Phase.

Twenty-eight or fewer days prior to starting the Chemo-radiation Phase, patients will have a baseline Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan.

Chemo-radiation Phase: In this, patient will be assigned to either a one week or a three week treatment group with radiation treatments given approximately 5 days a week as directed by the study doctor. During this time they will also take TMZ-chemo orally (by mouth) once a day on every evening including weekends starting the evening of the day that you start radiotherapy. Once radiation is completed, you will stop taking TMZ-chemo for approximately 4 weeks before going to the next phase.

Radiation therapy: Patients will be randomized between standard radiation treatment at UPMC Radiation Oncology facilities included in this protocol with either 40 Gy in 15 fractions or 25 Gy in 5 fractions, using 6 to 23 MV x-rays along with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy for both treatment schedules.

It was born from a better understanding of tumor growth requires the development of neo-vessels. These new vessels are of major importance for the viability of the tumor but also the birth of metastases. This neo-angiogenesis is complex and results from an imbalance between pro-angiogenic factors and anti-angiogenic factors. Growth factor VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) are a way of survival of endothelial cells required for tumor neoangiogenesis. The anti-angiogenic drugs currently available on the market are bevacizumab (Avastin ®), sunitinib (Sutent ®) and sorafenib (Nexavar ®). The mechanism of anti-angiogenic action of these three main drugs are pharmacological inhibition of the VEGF pathway.

These new anti-angiogenic therapies, however, have significant adverse effects are common and some other more serious but rare.

Hypertension is the most common side effect observed in patients treated with anti-VEGF. This is usually iatrogenic hypertension controlled by antihypertensive therapy and rarely compromises the pursuit of anti-angiogenic therapy. More rarely, it can have serious consequences malignant hypertension, severe hypertension refractory reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy associated with severe hypertension have also been reported.

The pathophysiology of hypertension may be due to the neutralization of major physiological effects of VEGF in endothelial cell and therefore the vascular wall.

The study of the microcirculation is not only useful in the diagnosis of microvascular but also macrovascular disease in the evaluation of chronic arterial and venous severe it determines the prognosis. In these indications, capillaroscopy remains the gold standard for all work pathophysiological because visualization of phenomena measured avoids artifacts and difficulties of interpretation. It then appealed to additional technology to directly measure the capillary pressure, capillary flow velocity, and indirectly assess capillary permeability and function of lymphatic canaliculi. The simplest of these technological inputs: video microscopy and digital image analysis, have also improved the practice of routine clinical capillaroscopy in its main field of application, evaluation of microangiopathy connective. The examination can be performed more quickly and easily archived and quantified.

Only two studies on 14 and 16 patients were able to see a decrease in capillary density correlated with the therapeutic activity of anti-angiogenic the tumor mass and metastasis.

Thus, we propose to quantify in a number of relatively large patient patients the decrease in capillary density as well as the relationship between the decrease in the number of capillaries and anti-tumor response.

The study will also aim to measure the prevalence of hypertension in patients treated with bevacizumab and to establish the link between these data and the modification of the capillary microcirculation.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01810744,,Adult,Metastatic,Unclear

This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA. Initial therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. All patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) is a technique that can effectively increase the concentration of drug delivered to the brain while sparing the body of systemic side effects. One currently used drug called, Bevacizumab (Avastin) has been shown to be active in human brain tumors but its actual CNS penetration is unknown. This phase I clinical research trial will test the hypothesis that Bevacizumab can be safely used by direct intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion up to a dose of 10mg/kg to ultimately enhance survival of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM/AA. By achieving the aims of this study we will determine the toxicity profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD of SIACI Bevacizumab. We expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of SIACI Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near future.","The current standard of care for recurring GBM is for patients to receive Bevacizumab (Avastin) intravenously (IV) at 10mg/kg with CPT-11 (Irinotecan) every two weeks until their tumor grows more than 25%. At that point, these patients are deemed treatment failures and are given another treatment. Because of the blood brain barrier (BBB) where IV drugs do not penetrate the blood vessel walls well to get into the brain, no one knows for sure if these IV drugs actually get into the brain after infusion. Previous studies have shown that if you want to increase your penetration of drug to the brain, that intra-carotid artery (intraarterial) delivery is superior to standard intravenous delivery. Previous techniques using intra arterial (intracarotid) infusion still were non-selective as drug delivery still went to all blood vessels in the brain, so patients still had significant adverse events, such as blindness. Newer techniques in interventional neuroradiology have allowed for a more selective delivery of catheters higher up into the arterial tree where agents such as chemotherapies, can be delivered without the risk of adverse affects such as blindness. In fact, studies here at Cornell and MSKCC have developed very new and exciting super selective intraarterial delivery treatment for Pediatric Eye Tumors with little toxicity. Therefore, this trial will ask one simple question: Is it safe to delivery a patient's first dose of Avastin intraarterially using these super selective delivery techniques instead of the standard intravenous route of administration? This should not only increase the amount of drug that gets to the tumor but also spare the patient any adverse effects from a less selective delivery. During that single dose of intraarterial Avastin, the patient will also receive a dose of mannitol that opens up the blood brain barrier to improve delivery of the agent to the brain. After that single dose of Mannitol and Avastin intraarterially, the patient will be evaluated for 4 weeks to assess for toxicity. If no toxicity, then the patient will go on and get the standard chemotherapy (Avastin and CPT-11) every two weeks as is routine unless they fail. After this you are done with the ""experimental"" aspects of the protocol. This is a Phase I trial that is designed to test the safety of the single dose intraarterial delivery of Avastin and Mannitol, prior to starting standard IV Avastin and CPT-11.

Day 0: Intraarterial Avastin single dose (starting at 2mg/kg and up to 10mg/kg) after Mannitol to open the blood brain barrier Day 28 (and every two weeks thereafter): Intravenous Avastin and CPT-11

1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol 25%; 3-10 mL/s for 30seconds) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.
2. To add a single intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of the Avastin prior to beginning the standard IV Avastin and CPT-11 therapy for patients with recurring or relapsing high grade glioma. After a one cycle observation period assess for toxicity from the IA infusion, the subject will receive Intravenous (IV) bevacizumab 10 mg/kg and irinotecan (CPT-11) 125mg/m2 every 14 days as is standard therapy for relapsing recurring GBM.

The dose escalation algorithm is as follows: We will use a single intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion of Avastin, starting at a dose of 2mg/kg in the first three patients. Assuming no dose limiting toxicity during the first 28 days after IA infusion, the patient will then begin their standard chemotherapy regimen which is Avastin and CPT-11 every two weeks. The doses will be escalated to 4,6,8 and finally 10mg/kg in this Phase I trial.

Inclusion criteria Include: Males or females, ≥18 years of age, with documented histologic diagnosis of relapsed or refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AOA).

Both hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity will be determined and scored according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Monitoring will be conducted by post procedure CT scan (at 6-12 hours post procedure), serial history, neurological and physical examinations together with serial blood counts, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and chemistries. MRI will be performed every two cycles or approximately every two months.

Response will be evaluated after two cycles of chemotherapy via a MRI with the injection of contrast. Subjects who show an objective response (reduction in tumor size) or stable disease after 2 cycles of treatment will be able to continue on study. Progressive disease will require that subjects be taken off the research protocol. The following will be evaluated every cycle, and then during follow-up: neurological examination, physical examination, performance status, laboratory parameters and review of adverse reactions. Contrast enhanced MRI (MRI with gadolinium is the preferable imaging study except in case where MRI is contraindicated i.e., in those with pacemakers or metallic implants. In these subjects, CT with contrast is acceptable) will be performed every two-treatment cycles under this research protocol. The following subjects will be taken off protocol: those with progressive disease; those who experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Follow-up will continue until disease progression or death. Survival will be measured from the time of the first dose of IA Avastin® (given at the start of each treatment cycle).

The patient will not be responsible for any additional costs associated with enrollment in the trial. All costs of the IA delivery will be submitted to the patient's insurance provider. WCMC will not be named as a sponsor of the study nor will it cover the cost of the experimental procedure.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00968240,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; pediatric,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Optune® has obtained a CE mark in Europe for recurrent and newly diagnosed GBM.

The current standard of care for GBM includes the addition of Optune® to maintenance temozolomide (TMZ), following the completion of radiation therapy (RT).

The purpose of the current study is to test if the earlier introduction of Optune®, at the time of radiation therapy (which is given together with temozolomide), improves clinical outcomes compared to the standard of care.

The study will randomize 950 subjects equally to one of two treatment arms:

1. Treatment arm I: Patients receive TTFields at 200 kHz to the brain using the Optune® System together with RT and TMZ, followed by maintenance TMZ concomitant with the Optune® treatment.
2. Treatment arm II: Patients receive RT and TMZ alone, followed by maintenance TMZ concomitant with TTFields at 200 kHz to the brain using the Optune®.

All patients are to receive standard RT and TMZ treatment followed by maintenance TMZ chemotherapy and Optune® according to the current standard of care regimen.

Optune® will continue until second disease progression per RANO Criteria unless any of the treatment discontinuation conditions described under criteria for patient withdrawal or termination are met.

After surgery or biopsy, subjects that would like to participate will be required to submit samples of their tumor to a lab for testing. The results of this test will be used for randomization into the trial.

If the subject is assigned to the treatment group that will start Optune® therapy during radiation therapy, Optune® therapy will begin within 10 days of enrolling in the study and no later than the first day of RT and TMZ treatment.

After the initial visit, subjects will continue treatment at home, while pursuing normal daily routines. Subjects are required to use the device for at least 18 hours a day. Short breaks in treatment for personal hygiene and other personal needs is allowed. Total usage time will be recorded and provided to the site and sponsor.

Subjects will be required to return to the clinic per the study protocol.

After the second disease progression, subjects will return to the clinic for one final visit approximately 30 days after the last treatment with Optune® or after second disease progression, the latter of the two per protocol.

After completing active participation in the study, subjects will be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04471844,chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

The glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive tumour originating from the brain, affecting approximately 600 patients per year in Belgium. The treatment consists in surgical resection of the tumour (when feasible), followed by a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite multimodal treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy), the life expectancy of patients with GBM remains limited, with an average survival of 12-18 months and only 5% of patients surviving more than 5 years. In addition to limited survival, most patients with GBM experience impaired quality of life, both because of the disease and treatments.

Radiotherapy is a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells. In GBM, radiotherapy is targeted at the tumour (or tumour bed if the tumour was resected) with a safety margin around it (the ""Clinical Target Volume"" or CTV) to account for potential microscopic spread of the tumour. The downside of this safety margin is that a substantial amount of brain tissue is irradiated, which can lead to treatment toxicity. Reducing the CTV margin would enable to decrease the volume of brain being irradiated and could thereby allow to reduce the side effects of brain irradiation.

The BELGICA trial (Achieving a BEtter outcome through Limiting the GlIoblastoma Clinical tArget volume) is a national multicentre trial which will evaluate if reducing the irradiation volume in glioblastoma is safe and allows for lowering side effects and improving quality of life.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06719440,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

The study will elucidate the diagnostic value of PET imaging with use of amyloid-β radioisotope tracer Amyvid (Florbetapir F18) for GBM. The results of the study will provide data for development of new approach for GBM diagnostics.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most malignant forms of brain cancer. Majority of GBMs relapse shortly after tumor resection, and the timely follow-up diagnosis and treatment is vital for patient's survival. However, chemo- and radiotherapeutic treatment of GBM patients cause metabolic and structural changes in brain parenchyma, manifested as metabolic and matrix remodeling modifications, and mimic tumor progression in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. This creates difficulties in discrimination of real tumor progression and post-treatment modifications. No current imaging techniques, including MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or perfusion MR (MRP) can provide effective determination of tumor progression and treatment-related changes of brain tissue, that represents current unmet clinical need. The goal of the study is to identify specific biomarker for GBM, that can be used for precise imaging and diagnostics.

The accumulation of amyloid-β in human GBM specimens and in mouse glioma implantation model was previously demonstrated. Intravenous administration of amyloid-β marker thioflavin T resulted in accumulation of fluorescence in brain tumors in mouse GBM model 15 minutes after administration and allowed detailed visualization of tumor structure with use of confocal microscopy. The hypothesis of the study is that Amyvid (Florbetapir F18), a radioisotope tracer, that binds amyloid aggregates and is currently used for brain PET diagnostics of Alzheimer disease, can be used as a safe and effective marker for PET diagnostics of recurrent GBM.

The central study question: if Amyvid-PET provides visualization of GBM tumors and discriminate recurrent tumor and post-treatment tissue modifications in human brain, and thus presents the potential for amyloid-binding radioisotope tracers as GBM diagnostic tool. The purpose of the study is to characterize and describe the ability of Amyvid to reach GBM tumor in humans and to bind specific tumor structures as necrotic, middle and invasion areas of tumor, as well as blood vessel structures and extracellular matrix in tumor.

One of our studies \[Ciammella P, 2013, 8:222\] reported a median survival of 9.5 months in patients with recurrent GBM and treated with stereotactic radiotherapy with a total dose of 25 Gy in 5 consecutive sessions, in which the dose was prescribed to 70% isodose with a homogeneous gradient towards the center of the target volume. The identification with functional imaging of specific areas with higher tumor cell density, and the possibility of delivering precisely, thanks to the most advanced therapy units, different doses to the different sub-volumes, can lead to an increase in the maximum dose that can be delivered at the expense of the most aggressive areas (with a greater effect on the tumor), compared to smaller doses in areas with lower signal alteration. This selectivity of the doses should allow an increase in the efficacy of the therapy and therefore a hypothetical increase in local control, compared to a radio-induced toxicity on the surrounding healthy tissues almost comparable to that achieved with the previous hypofractionated treatments \[Ciammella P, 2013\]. In fact, delivering many high doses to the entire volume would result in an excess of radio-induced necrosis within the irradiated regions with high dose, as well as the impossibility of minimizing the doses on healthy areas and / or on non-neoplastic critical areas keeping them at internal dose ranges related to minimal and acceptable toxicity levels. Since there are no studies providing clear indications on the acute and late toxicity of irradiated healthy tissues that have already been the subject of a first course of radiotherapy (STUPP), the choice of safety is the primary objective of the study.","It is an exploratory, prospective, experimental, monocentric study. Having identified a main safety endpoint (toxicity of radiotherapy treatment) and in the absence of data currently available from previous studies and useful for sizing the sample, the sample is defined according to opportunity and feasibility criteria, (12 cases), with a drawing (3 cases + 3 cases + 6 cases) which provides for two intermediate safety assessment steps one month after the end of the third and sixth patient treatment. The study will be continued only in case of positive evaluation of both steps. For each individual patient the treatment is considered completed if: a) the experimental radiotherapy treatment has been completed; b) the first follow-up radiological assessment (NMR) was performed; c) the study treatment was prematurely interrupted due to lack of efficacy (documented disease progression) or unacceptable toxicity.

* Treatment: the treatment foreseen by the protocol foresees the planning and the execution of a hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) treatment, administered in 5 daily sessions, with intensity modulated technique and inhomogeneous distribution of the dose guided by the diffusion images obtained with magnetic resonance (RM). The radiotherapy treatment must start within 7 days from the date of execution of the centering MRI which will include both the classic morphological sequences with administration of contrast medium and functional ones. In selected cases and according to clinical judgment it will be possible to request the revision of the anatomopathological and radiological findings.
* Radiation technique: for each patient, a radiotherapy treatment plan will be performed with conformed techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with dose redistribution: dose-painting.
* Positioning and immobilization of the patient: the patient must be treated in a supine position. The arms must be positioned along the body. The use of a knee support is recommended. The garment will be immobilized with a thermoplastic mask and corresponding neck rest supports.
* TC and planning RM: the planning CT should be acquired possibly with reduced layer thickness that contains the entire volume of the skull and the upper part of the shoulders. This is done to allow the possibility of planning non-coplanar type treatments. The last follow-up MRI, or the radiotherapy centering RM, composed of standard and functional sequences, is used for planning, in addition to those that the neuroradiologist will have considered useful to better characterize the clinical case under examination. More details on this are described in the Technical Annex.
* Target volume and organs at risk (OAR): the following target volumes must be identified: • Gross tumor volume (GTV): it is defined using and combining the conventional and advanced sequences of the NMR. • Planning target volume (PTV): it is represented by the GTV with three-dimensional expansion between 0 and 5 mm according to the problems highlighted during the tumor segmentation phase. See the Technical Annex in this regard.
* The following risky organs (OAR) must be identified: • Optical nerves: the definition of the related planning risk volume is also suggested (PRV: organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering TC and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). • chiasm. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). • retinas. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). Alternatively the eye globes can be surrounded. • Encefalic trunk.
* The following secondary OARs must be identified: • Lenses / Crystalline. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). • Healthy brain tissue. It is represented by the encephalon volume minus the PTV. • Screw. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin).
* Dose prescription: i) Dose to the target: the prescription dose foresees a minimum dose of 30 Gy (6 Gy per session) for the areas with the highest ADC with a gradual increase in the dose of the lower ADC areas. The maximum hypothesized dose is 50 Gy, with a dose of 10 Gy per session to no more than 1cc of the irradiated brain tissue. The treatment plan, however, will be processed in the following order of priority: 1. Compliance with dose limits for primary OARs. 2. PTV coverage. 3. Compliance with dose limits for secondary OARs.
* Dose limits for primary risk organs: in the scientific literature there are various studies that indicate the dose limits of the organs at risk for brain radiation treatments.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04610229,imaging,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

The objective of the study is to demonstrate that this surgical technique is safe in a small human cohort of patients with resected newly diagnosed GBM and may improve progression-free survival (PFS).","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary central nervous system malignancy in adults, and accounts for over half of all malignant brain tumors. The prognosis for newly diagnosed GBM is extremely poor even with Stupp protocol consisting of surgery followed by temozolomide and radiotherapy. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months and treatment for GBM remains a significant unmet clinical need in oncology.

All subjects included in the study will initially undergo standard surgical resection for newly diagnosed GBM. Following the resection, the surgical cavity will be lined with a long pedicled, autologous piece of tissue called a temporoparietal fascial flap or pericranium. The patient's dura, bone and scalp will be closed as is customary. The permeability of the blood vessels of the TPF or pericranial flap should allow for improved delivery of therapeutics and immune cells (macrophages and T cells) into the vicinity, extracellular space and microenvironment of the resected tumor cavity including the brain adjacent to the GBM. The TPF or pericranial flap would easily conform to many resected GBM cavities in our human patients with acceptable risk. The TPF and pericranial flap with its predictable and rich vascular anatomy have been shown to be an ideal flap for cases of previously irradiated and/or infected wound beds.

The investigators hypothesize that a TPF or pericranial flap that is harvested in our patients with resected GBM may be used as a readily available and accessible means of circumventing the blood brain barrier selectively and focally. The investigators aim to prove that this surgical technique is safe in a small human cohort of patients with resected newly diagnosed GBM and may improve progression-free survival (PFS).",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03630289,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer. Treatments include radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. But survival rates are poor. Researchers think that the drug selinexor, when combined with chemotherapy and radiation, might help.

Objective:

To learn the highest dose of selinexor that people with brain cancer can tolerate when given with temozolomide and radiation therapy.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older with brain cancer that has not been treated with chemotherapy or radiation.

Design:

Participants will be screened under another protocol.

Before participants start treatment, they will have tests:

Neurological and physical evaluations

Blood and urine tests

Possible computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain if they have not had one in 3 weeks. Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They may have a dye injected into a vein.

Surveys about their well-being

Participants will have radiation to the brain for up to 6 weeks. This will usually be given once a day, Monday through Friday.

Starting the second day of radiation, participants will take selinexor by mouth once a week. They will take it in weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5. The timing may be changed.

Starting the first day of radiation, participants will take temozolomide by mouth once a day until they complete radiation.

Participants will have blood tests once per week during treatment.

Participants will have a follow-up visit 1 month after they complete treatment. Then they will have visits at least every 2 months for the first 2 years, then at least every 3 months for another year. Visits will include MRIs and blood tests.","Background:

* Although radiation has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with glioblastoma (GBM), median survival remains poor. Even with the addition of temozolomide (TMZ) to surgical resection and radiotherapy, most GBMs will recur in field or adjacent to the high dose radiation volume.
* High rates of local failure indicate that GBM cells in situ are relatively radioresistant and that the effectiveness of GBM radiotherapy would benefit from additional radiosensitization.
* Selinexor has recently been shown to enhance the radiosensitivity of glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Objectives:

-Assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of selinexor when combined with temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and gliosarcoma.

Tandutinib (MLN518) along with bevacizumab represents an attempt to further capitalize on the concept of targeting the tumor vasculature. Tandutinib is a small molecule inhibitor of fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and cKIT (type III receptor tyrosine kinases). It has demonstrated anti-leukemic activity in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose blasts contain an activating internal tandem duplication mutation of FLT3. However, in this study tandutinib is being added to bevacizumab primarily for its activity against the PDGFR and cKIT. Hannahan and colleagues have demonstrated the additional anti-tumor activity that results in vivo with combined inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and PDGFR. The activity of PDGFR inhibition is hypothesized to result from its effect on pericytes, the cells that surround and support endothelial cells. These cells have abundant expression of PDGFR and require platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-PDGFR interaction for their normal function.

Objectives

To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of the combination of bevacizumab and tandutinib in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, as determined by progression-free-survival.

Eligibility

Patients with histologically proven recurrent malignant glioma are eligible for this study.

Design

Patients will receive tandutinib as a single agent at a daily dose of 500 mg PO bid for the first 14 days of treatment. Radiology: Prior to the first dose of tandutinib patients will undergo an MRI-perfusion scan and an FDG-PET scan. An MRI-perfusion scan will then be repeated between days 12-14 of the first 14 days of tandutinib monotherapy. On day 15, treatment with bevacizumab will be added to the ongoing treatment with tandutinib. Bevacizumab will be given intravenously in a dose of 10 mg/kg, repeated once every 2 weeks. After completion of the first 4 weeks of combined tandutinib and bevacizumab therapy (6 weeks after initiating treatment with tandutinib) considered the first cycle of therapy) the MRI-perfusion and fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans will be repeated before the next dose of bevacizumab is given. Patients who are clinically/neurologically stable, and who have radiographically stable or responding disease at the end of that first cycle and every cycle thereafter (every 4 weeks), will continue treatment with tandutinib and bevacizumab. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-perfusion scans will be repeated after the completion of every 4 weeks of therapy. A total of 80 patients will be enrolled to this study (GBM (glioblastoma multiforme)=40, AG=40)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00667394,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Primary

* Tolerability and safety of IMA950 adjuvanted with Poly-ICLC when given together with temozolomide, using CTCAE V 4.0.
* Immunogenicity of IMA950 plus Poly-ICLC when given together with temozolomide.

Secondary

* 6, 9 month progression free survival (PFS) using gadolinium enhanced MRI and clinical assessment according to revised RANO criteria
* Overall survival (OS)
* Immunologic endpoints (correlation between clinical and immunological responses):
* evaluation of peptide immunogenicity by tetramer staining
* analysis of memory, activation and homing marker expression by tetramer positive cells
* analysis of cytokine secretion and proliferation by antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells
* analysis of the presence of T regulatory and myeloid-derived suppressor cells
* The immunological analyses will be performed on:
* peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
* cultures of skin punch biopsy at delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) site
* tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) if brain tissue is available at recurrence

OUTLINE

This is a monocentric, open label, one cohort, safety and immunogenicity, Phase I/II study.

A maximum of 16 HLA-A2 positive patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will be enrolled into the study after treatment with radiation therapy and concurrent temozolomide.

All patients will receive the same dose of IMA950 with Poly-ICLC and follow the same vaccination schedule which comprises a Vaccination Induction Phase of 4 intensive vaccinations, followed by a Vaccination Maintenance Phase of five vaccinations over a longer period.

The Vaccination Induction Phase will start a minimum of 7 days after the final radiotherapy/TMZ dose of CRT and 28 days (+7 days) prior to the first scheduled dose of adjuvant TMZ.

This will ensure that all 4 vaccinations in the Induction Phase will be administered a week after immunosuppressive therapy (i.e. combined radiotherapy and temozolomide) and will finish a week prior to the start of adjuvant TMZ.

Two Phases :

Induction phase, patient receive the first 4 doses of Poly ICLC mixed with IMA 950 Peptide based vaccine (subcutaneously or IM) on days 1,8,15, and 21 in absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Maintenance Phase, patient receive Poly ICLC mixed with IMA 950 Peptide based vaccine (SC or IM) on day 21 of each adjuvant temozolomide cycle in absence unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Immunomonitoring assessments will be performed at 8 time points with blood samples collection and one DTH site analysis(after vaccination 5).

Brain MRI will be performed every two months for disease assessment.

N.B. :

An amendment has been accepted by Swissmedic and Local Ethics committee on september 2014, after suboptimal immunomonitoring preliminary assessments, the schedule of administration has been changed in order to improve the immunogenicity of the vaccine, as follows :

* injection of mixed peptides and adjuvant Poly ICLC
* 4 vaccinations in the induction phase instead of 6
* one site of injection (thigh)
* two arms for the next 10 patients to be included that will be equally divided in 2 groups : one group will be vaccinated subcutaneously and the other intramuscularly.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01920191,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Overall, 90 subjects will be enrolled and parallel assigned in a 1:1 fashion to one of six treatment arms (from A to F) of 15 patients each.

Each arm has a different combination of L19TNF (7 μg/kg or 10 μg/kg or 13 μg/kg) and lomustine at different dose levels (90 or 110 mg/m2).

Treatment is based on a 42-day cycle for up to a maximum of 6 cycles.

This is an open-label study, so there is no blinding.

Patients who successfully complete the screening evaluations and are eligible for participation in the study will be enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to either of the six parallel treatment arms.

To maintain an appropriate balance between the six treatment arms and avoid undesired confounding effect of different factors, patients will be randomized in accordance with the following strata:

* MGMT status
* Steroid administration
* Previous systemic therapy treatment for progression

A randomization list will be prepared for each stratum using permuted block, the block sizes will be chosen randomly from different, pre-specified sizes with an equal treatment allocation ratio. The labels for the arms are assigned randomly within each block (fixed seed). The obtained final list is sorted by block together with the progressive enrollment number for the patients.

The primary objective of this study is to select the optimal regimen of L19TNF in combination with lomustine, that maximizes effects on clinical parameters and minimizes the probability of moderate to severe adverse events, among six (three L19TNF doses x two lomustine doses) combination schedules for the treatment of patient with progressing or recurrent glioblastoma.

Primary endpoints include Safety (Incidence of adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI), standard laboratory assessments, ECG, ECHO and physical examination according to CTCAE v.5.0) and Efficacy (Survival rate at 12 months).

The secondary objective of this study is to further evaluate safety, efficacy, exposure, dose-response, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information of the combination of L19TNF and lomustine at different dose levels to determine the best dose regimen for further studies.

During the conduct of the study the safety information collected will be routinely reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in order to identify possible safety concerns.

If the probability in a treatment arm that the development of unacceptable toxicity rate exceeds 33 % is equal or higher than 80%, the recruitment to this treatment arm will be interrupted and the DSMB will be informed to assess the events and relationship to the study treatment. The DSMB may then recommend to re-start recruitment again for the treatment arm or permanently suspend it.

In case of a treatment-related death, recruitment will be suspended for all treatment arms until the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has reviewed the event and recommended to restart",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06336291,,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

We also want to learn about the effects, if any, these drugs have on children and young adults with brain tumors.

We are asking people to be in this research study who have been diagnosed with a high grade glioma, their tumor has been screened for the Rb1 protein, and they have recently finished radiation therapy. If a patient has DIPG or a Bi-thalamic high grade glioma, they do not need to have the tumor tissue screened for the Rb1 protein, but do need to have finished radiation therapy.

Tumor cells grow and divide quickly. In normal cells, there are proteins that control how fast cells grow but in cancer cells these proteins no longer work correctly making tumor cells grow quickly. Both study drugs work in different ways to slow down the growth of tumor cells. The researchers think that if the study drugs are given together soon after radiation therapy, it may help improve the effect of the radiation in stopping or slowing down tumor growth.

The study drugs, ribociclib and everolimus, have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ribociclib is approved to treat adults with breast cancer and everolimus is approved for use in adults and children who have other types of cancers. The combination of ribociclib and everolimus has not been tested in children or in people with brain tumors and is considered investigational.

The goals of this study are:

* Find the safest dose of ribociclib and everolimus that can be given together after radiation.
* Learn the side effects (both good and bad) the study drugs have on the body and tumor.
* Measure the levels of study drug in the blood over time.
* Study the changes in the endocrine system that may be caused by the tumor, surgery or radiation.","This is a phase I study to determine: 1) the MTD and/or the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ribociclib and everolimus which can be safely administered during maintenance therapy for up to 24 courses following completion of radiation therapy with newly diagnosed non-biopsied DIPG and RB+ biopsied DIPG and HGG, 2) characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile of ribociclib and everolimus as combination maintenance therapy following completion of radiation therapy with newly diagnosed non-biopsied DIPG and RB+ biopsied DIPG and HGG.

Patients with RB+ tumors and non-biopsied DIPG will receive standard radiation therapy prior to enrollment followed by ribociclib and everolimus as maintenance therapy. Upon completion of radiation therapy, a 2 - 4 week break will occur and then ribociclib will be given orally daily for 21 days followed by a 7 day break every 28 days at 70% of the adult RP2D (300 mg) in combination with everolimus at 80% of the adult RP2D (2.5 mg) given orally once daily continuously for up to 24 courses. One course is equivalent to 28 days. Due to dosing concerns with the limited dosing capsules (50 mg and 200 mg are only available), dose escalations will have BSA restrictions to accommodate for variations from target doses and BSA adjusted actual dose.

Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive form of primary and malignant tumor of the brain. Currently, the standard of care for this disease includes surgical resection, followed by radiation with chemotherapy and tumor treating fields. Despite this aggressive therapy, the survival after finishing treatment remains low and the disease often reoccurs. Unfortunately, the available therapy options for recurrent glioblastoma are minimal and do not have a great effect on survival. AMSCs are found in body fat and when separated from the fat, are delivered into the surgical cavity at the time of surgery. When in direct contact with tumor cells, AMSCs affect tumor growth, residual tumor cell death, and chemotherapy resistance.

6-Thioguanine is a drug that helps to increase the effects of Temozolomide and CCNU on tumor cells.

Depending on the previous treatment you have received, you will be treated according to Arms 1, 2, or 3.

If you have not received temozolomide before, you will be treated on Arm 1. If you have received temozolomide before but only during radiation therapy and not as chemotherapy afterwards and the treatment was over 6 months ago, you will be treated with temozolomide according to Arm 1.

If you have not received lomustine or carmustine, you will be treated on Arm 2. If you have received Gliadel wafers at surgery greater than 6 months ago and have not been treated with lomustine or carmustine, you will be treated with CCNU according to Arm 2.

Arm 3 will include glioblastoma multiforme patients who may be treated with either temozolomide or lomustine according to the above guidelines and regimens described in Arms 1 and 2.

Arm 1:

Treatment will begin with 6-thioguanine taken by mouth 4 times a day (every 6 hours) for 3 days in a row (Days 1-3). This will be followed by temozolomide taken by mouth at bedtime for 5 days in a row (Days 4-8).

Arm 2:

Treatment will begin with 6-thioguanine taken by mouth 4 times a day (every 6 hours) for 3 days in a row (Days 1-3). This will be followed by lomustine taken by mouth at bedtime for 1 day (Day 4). After a rest period of 1 week, capecitabine and celecoxib will be taken by mouth twice a day (12 hours apart) for 14 days (Days 11-24). Each cycle of treatment on arm 2 will take 42 days.

Blood tests (less than 2 teaspoons) will be repeated every 2 weeks and before each new cycle of treatment (a total of about 2 tablespoons). The neurological exam, anticonvulsant level blood tests and the stool test for blood, will be repeated before every cycle on Arms 2 and 3 (CCNU) and before every 2 cycles on Arms 1 and 3 (temozolomide). Kidney function will be evaluated from the blood tests before every other course. Patients taking anticoagulants (coumadin, warfarin) will have procedures to test the clotting ability of the blood before each cycle or more frequently if the doctor feels it is necessary.

Arm 3:

Glioblastoma Multiforme patients will be treated on Arm 3 which will include the drug regimen from either Arm 1 or Arm 2.

Treatment on all arms will continue for 1 year as long as the tumor does not grow and any side effects are tolerable. Treatment may continue beyond one year if your doctor feels it is needed.

Replication of M032 in the tumor itself not only kills the infected tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus carries a therapeutic payload--acting as a gene therapy vector, too--and causes the tumor cell to synthesize and secrete an immunity-stimulating protein called Interleukin-12 (IL-12) before it is killed. This IL-12 is released and promotes an immune response against surviving tumor cells, which increases the antitumor effect of the therapy. The IL-12 that is expressed can also produce an anti-angiogenic effect, by interfering with the production of new tumor blood vessels necessary to allow tumor growth. Anti-angiogenic therapies potentially starve the tumor of necessary oxygen and nutrients. Thus, the M032 oHSV produces three different potential mechanisms for antitumor effects.

To correlate the OS and PFS in relation to the change between baseline and end of study neurocognitive function as measured by the evoked potential P300 (normal), the baseline corticosteroid dose, the average daily corticosteroid dose over the whole study duration, those who for tolerability reasons do not complete the temozolomide standard 6 monthly pulses of therapy and the presence and severity of immune related adverse events (irAE's).

To assess and compare above mentioned biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with second surgical resection ie treatment failures.

To assess in this GBM population the duration of pseudoprogression and the lagtime needed for immunotherapy to become effective.

Study Design: This is a single center, phase 2, open label, add-on, single dose study in patients receiving standard therapy for newly diagnosed GBM. In total 30 patients who meet the entry criteria will be entered into the study within 3 weeks of finishing their last day of combined radiotherapy/temozolamide. Avelumab will be initiated concurrently with the initiation of the first 5 day, monthly cycle of temozolamide and continued for a total of 260 weeks.

A local pathology report will constitute adequate documentation of histology for study inclusion.

The tumor block used for diagnosis of GBM must be collected for each patient and sent for MGMT assessment (if not already done), biomarker and immunoscore analysis. The availability of these samples is mandatory for randomization into the study, and they must be sent within 2 months after patient's entry into the study for analysis.

Paraffin embedded blocks containing formalin-fixed tumor tissue representative of the glioblastoma diagnosis is the preferred sample (if available, and of sufficient quality), otherwise, a partial tumor block, or pathology material should be sent. If surgery was not performed but biopsy was performed (or if it is not possible to send FFPE tumor tissue blocks) at least 10 unstained, uncovered slides must be sent.

The study will consist of 3 different phases: a Combination Phase, a Monotherapy Phase and an Extended Safety Follow-up Phase

Combination Phase: Upon completion of the standard combination therapy of radiotherapy (total dose 60 Gy, administered as daily 2Gy fractions, 5 days/week) and temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day p.o. qd) and a treatment break of no more than 21 days, the combination phase will start. Patients will receive temozolomide and avelumab for 6 cycles of 28 days each. During the 1st cycle Temozolomide will be given the first 5 days at a dose of 150mg/m2/day p.o. In the next cycle, the temozolomide dose should be escalated to 200/mg/m2 if permitted by the patient's hematological and non-hematological toxicity profile (as per NCI-CTC AE version 3). The temozolomide dose will be adjusted according to hematological and non-hematological toxicity as per temozolomide's product monograph (appendix 4). Avelumab will be administered on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle at a dose of 10mg/kg IV. Avelumab therapy will be withheld according to the occurrence and severity of avelumab related adverse events as per table 3. Patients will continue the combination of temozolomide (150-200mg/m2 per day PO X5 days Q28days) and avelumab (at 10mg/kg dose, IV on days 1 and 15 per cycle) until 6 cycles are completed or until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable (grade 3 or higher) avelumab related toxicity occurs.

Monotherapy Phase: Upon completion of the Combination Phase or upon stopping temozolomide because of temozolomide related toxicity the patient will continue into the avelumab Monotherapy Phase. Avelumab 10mg/kg IV Q2weeks will be continued as monotherapy until a total of 260 weeks of avelumab has been received or evidence of confirmed disease progression as per the iRANO definition or unacceptable (grade 3 or higher) avelumab related toxicity has occurred.

Patients who experience irAE's may according to table 3 directives have their avelumab therapy suspended.

The use of Bevacizumab, second surgical resection or re-irradiation will not be allowed in the study and will be considered as evidence of disease progression.

Patients will be promptly informed upon confirmation of disease progression as per the new iRANO criteria. They will be offered to pursue with the avelumab therapy as per protocol or to withdraw from therapy and enter the extended safety follow up phase.

Upon completion of the Monotherapy Phase at week 260 patients will be then be offered the option of being rolled over into an open label extension study or receive commercial avelumab via a special access program.

Extended Safety Follow-up Phase:

Patients who discontinue avelumab therapy for any reason at any point in the study will be entered into an extended safety follow-up period of 90 days. Treatment will then be at the investigator or local oncologist's discretion. All subjects will be observed for the possible occurrence of delayed irAE's. Survival data and information about subsequent therapies will be collected. Tissue samples in patients undergoing second surgical resections will be obtained for further biomarker analysis.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03047473,surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy,Adult,Primary,Surgery

It has been known that viruses may kill tumor cells. When tumor cells are mixed with certain viruses in the laboratory, the tumor cells die. The DNA of the (HSV) virus has been modified so that tumor cells may be killed when infected by C134. The changes made to the virus (HSV) should help prevent the (C134) virus from infecting normal brain tissue. Extensive testing in both mice and monkeys has demonstrated that C134 is not able to cause HSV when injected directly into the brain. C134 may also be able to help kill tumor cells because it can prevent tumor cells from killing it more effectively than other, similar viruses can. This allows it to infect and kill more brain tumor cells. C134 has been tested in more than ten patients previously. The virus has had only two instances of known significant toxicities. In one patients with extensive disease present on both sides of the brain, the virus traveled throughout the brain and as a result, caused extensive inflammation that required treatment with an antiviral drug. The patient recovered partially, but eventually succumbed to their tumor. A second patient developed an infection of the retina (back of the eye) apparently as a result of the virus migrating to that area from the site of inoculation in the occipital lobe.

Based on these findings the investigators have amended the protocol to protect future patients from these toxicities as follows: 1) The dose of the virus being administered has been lowered; 2) patients with enhancing tumor on both sides of the brain are not eligible for the trial and 3) patients with disease in the occipital lobe which has connections to the retina are not eligible for the trial

Based on laboratory testing, the investigators believe multiple doses of C134 viral therapy in cases such as the patients, could potentially benefit from repeat treatment as this has been seen in preclinical studies, since the patients have received C134, the patients are thus eligible for retreatment under this protocol.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06193174,,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

These tumors are characterized by diverse molecular abnormalities (within the same tumor), which, along with the difficulties of many standard chemotherapies crossing the blood barrier, contribute to the very poor response to therapy and poor survival.

We recently showed that Dichloroacetate (DCA, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) was able to depolarize cancer (but not normal) mitochondria and induce apoptosis in cancer but not normal tissues. We believe that altering the metabolism of cancers like glioblastoma (DCA switches metabolism from the cytoplasmic glycolysis to the mitochondrial glucose oxidation) we inhibit the resistance to apoptosis that characterizes cancer. Because metabolism (i.e. glycolysis) is the end result of many and diverse molecular pathways, the effects of DCA might be positive in cancers with diverse molecular backgrounds. DCA is also a very small molecule that readily crosses the blood brain barrier. Therefore we hypothesize that DCA will be an effective and relative non-toxic potential therapy for malignant gliomas.

We are conducting a phase II trial with 2 parallel arms: a) patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas and b) patients with recurrent gliomas or gliomas that have failed standard therapy (which includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy). All patients need to have a histological diagnosis. DCA will be given orally and patients will be followed for a minimum of 6 months. The tumor size will be followed by standard MRI or CT criteria and glucose uptake (a direct effect of DCA on the tumor) will be measured by FDG-PET imaging. Several clinical parameters and quality of life will be followed. Potential toxicity (particularly peripheral neuropathy) will be closely followed and dose-de-escalation protocols are in place in case of toxicity. In addition, escape protocols for the application of standard therapy (when appropriate) are in place in patients with no evidence of response to DCA. In vitro studies will be performed in the tissues obtained at the time of surgery (where appropriate) and correlated prospectively with clinical data.

NCT04838782,Role of Repeat Resection in Recurrent Glioblastoma (4rGBM) Trial: a Randomized Care Trial for Patients with Recurrent GBM,RECRUITING,['NA'],INTERVENTIONAL,250,ESTIMATED,,8/26/2021,1/1/2031,1/1/2030,University of Alberta,,Recurrent Glioblastoma; Glioblastoma - Category,Repeat Surgical Management of Recurrent GBM,18 years,,ALL,"Patients with recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM) are commonly presented to surgeons, along with the question of whether or not to re-resect the recurrence. There is no Level 1 evidence to support a role for repeat surgery in this context, but a multitude of observational research suggests that repeat surgery may improve quality survival. Unfortunately, these studies all suffer from selection bias.

The goal of this study is to provide a care trial context to help neurosurgeons manage patients presenting with recurrent GBM, with no additional risks, tests, or interventions than what they would normally encounter in routine care. Secondary goals include a test of the hypothesis that repeat resection can improve median overall survival, and that it can increase the number of days of survival outside of a hospital/nursing/palliative care facility.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor (48.3% of malignant tumors).1 It has a predilection for Caucasian men with a mean age of 65.1, 2 There are approximately 13,000 new diagnoses of GBM made every year in the United States.1 Patients have an average survival of 12-15 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 6.8% despite various treatments.1 If the prognosis at the time of initial diagnosis is grim, it is even worse at the time of recurrence. Recurrence after the initial resection, which can be symptomatic or discovered on surveillance MRI imaging, occurs in nearly all patients, usually within the first year, even when the initial management is aggressive.3-6 There is no standard way to care for recurrent GBM patients and treatment may include one or more of the following: repeat surgery, radiation therapy, or second-line chemotherapy.7

Repeat surgical management carries a greater risk of wound infection and cerebrospinal fluid leak than the initial surgery, especially in patients who received radiation.8 When maximal resection was attempted at the time of the initial procedure, the second surgery is more at risk of neurological injury. Repeat surgical management often also entails a delay in the initiation of further chemotherapy, as these agents are not administered peri-operatively because of potentially deleterious effects on wound healing. Nonetheless, despite, or because of the desperate setting, patients and surgeons are often pressed to consider repeat surgery, which is performed in at least 10-30% of patients.9 Repeat surgical treatment may be more favorable with younger age (\<60 years), and preoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of at least 70.9 Median survival following repeat resection varies between 13-54 weeks,10, 11 but all reports suffer from the limitations of retrospective studies, the most obvious being selection bias in terms of patient age, functional status, tumor location and size.11, 12 Yet, despite favorable biases some studies report no improvement in terms of survival or quality of life.13, 14 Two recent systematic meta-analyses of case series offer conflicting conclusions about the merit of re-operation.15, 16

If the intent of repeat surgery is to improve quality and quantity of life, there is no level 1 evidence it is effective.3, 16, 17 Thus repeat surgery should be considered the experimental arm of a randomized trial designed in the best interest of the patient, being only offered as a 50% chance, always balanced by a 50% chance of being allocated non-surgical care, or a chance to escape what could turn out to be unnecessary or harmful surgery.18 For patients may be better served by being free to pursue other life priorities in the company of loved ones rather than being scheduled to endure repeat craniotomy and multiple clinical or research follow-up visits. There is sufficient community equipoise to support the conduct of such a randomized trial.19

Tria Design:

The trial is a simple, all-inclusive, prospective, multicenter, randomized care trial18 that allocates 1:1 re-operation (or not) for patients with recurrent Glioblastoma. The primary outcome is overall survival. Secondary outcomes include standard peri-operative safety outcomes and (a notion of) 'quality survival', or survival at home, measured by counting days of survival minus days in hospital/nursing home/palliative care setting. Blinding is not feasible; treatment allocation will not be masked. The trial allows for pre-randomization.22 The burden of the proof of benefit is on surgery. While some patients allocated non-surgical management may still want surgery, and some patients allocated surgery may prefer non-surgical management, we feel participating patients will be better informed by the discussion around trial participation.

Hypothesis:

Patients with recurrent Glioblastoma, at the time they are considered for repeat resection, who undergo repeat resection for the GBM, will experience an increase in median overall survival from 6 to 9 months.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04838782,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

All patients will be informed about the study and potential risks and required to provide written informed consent prior to undergoing study-related procedures.

There will be a total of 11 Dose Levels. Dose-escalation for Dose Levels 1 through 5 proceeded according to standard 3+3 design using a 28-day DLT window. The first cohort of 3 patients enrolled into the study received Dose Level 1 followed by increments as per the modified Fibonacci sequence. It is anticipated that approximately 46 patients will be enrolled in order to determine the MTD of ONC206.

For Dose Levels 1 through 5, a safety evaluation was conducted when 3 evaluable patients have completed 1 cycle (28 days) of therapy. After Protocol Amendment 6, all available PK data will also be considered for dose escalation decisions. Dose levels may be adjusted based on review of PK data but will not exceed maximum dose levels described in Table 6. Additionally, dose frequencies (e.g., once daily or 3 times daily) may be added and/or removed based on emerging PK data and concentration projections.

Prior to advancing/changing dose levels, a cohort summary must be completed and submitted to the sponsor Medical Monitor, for review and approval. Dose escalation for subsequent patients will proceed as follows:

* If no DLT is reported at a dose level, that dose level will be considered safe, and patient(s) will be enrolled at the next dose level. Toxicity information will continue to be evaluated from the time of the first protocol specific intervention, until 30 days from the last dose of study drug.
* If 1 patient in a cohort of 1 experiences a DLT, the dose level will be expanded to obtain an additional 2 evaluable patients.
* If 1 patient in a cohort at a dose level experiences a DLT, the dose level will be expanded to obtain an additional 3 evaluable patients.
* If 2 of 3 patients in a cohort at a dose level experience a DLT, that dose level will not be considered safe, no further dose escalation will take place, and the MTD will have been exceeded\*.
* If 1 patient experiences a DLT among the expanded cohort of evaluable patients, a cohort of 3 patients will be enrolled in the next higher dose level.
* If 2 or more patients experience a DLT among the expanded cohort of evaluable patients, that dose level will not be considered safe, no further dose escalation will take place, and the MTD will have been exceeded\*. The previous dose level at which ≤1 patients experienced a DLT will be declared the MTD.

  * When the MTD has been exceeded:

If less than 6 patients have been treated in the next lower dose level (the possible MTD level), additional patients will be entered into this dose level until there are 6 patients treated. If ≤1 of these 6 patients encountered DLT, then this dose level will be declared to be the MTD. If 2 or more of the 6 patients encounter DLT, then the MTD has been exceeded.

Given the experience with ONC201, it is possible a MTD may not be reached through the planned dose escalation cohorts. If the therapeutic target concentrations have been achieved in the dose escalation cohorts, and no DLT has been identified, then analysis of the safety and PK data will be evaluated by the Investigators and the Sponsor. Further dose levels may then be considered at higher intermittent dosing schedules and will be added by protocol amendment with review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) before implementation.

Toxicities will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 24.0 (CTCAE 24.0). If the CTCAE 24.0 does not apply to an adverse event, it will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe.

DLTs will be assessed during the first course of each cohort (28 days), and refers to a study drug related or possibly related event that meets 1 of the following criteria using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0:

* Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity.
* Grade 4 hematologic toxicity (ANC \<0.5 × 109/L and platelet count \<25 × 109/L). Lymphopenia is not considered a DLT. A confirmed DLT requires 2 consecutive measurements separated by 48 hours.
* Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC \<1.0 × 109/L) with elevated fever (\>101°F). A confirmed DLT requires 2 consecutive measurements.
* Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding.
* Inability to receive the scheduled Cycle 2, Day 1 dose of study drug within 14 days due to study drug-related toxicity persisting from Cycle 1 or study drug-related toxicity newly encountered on Day 1 of Cycle 2.

Safety and tolerability will be monitored by assessing physical examinations including height (at Screening only) and weight, KPS, vital signs, ECG, laboratory assessments including hematology, chemistry, and coagulation, as well as collecting of the AEs at every visit.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04541082,,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

While vaccines are usually thought of as ways to prevent diseases, vaccines can also be used to treat cancer. SurVaxM is designed to tell the body's immune system to look for tumor cells that express a protein called survivin and destroy them. The survivin protein can be found on up to 95% of glioblastomas and other types of cancer but is not found in normal cells. If the body's immune system knows to destroy cells that express survivin, it may help to control tumor growth and recurrence.

SurVaxM will be mixed with Montanide ISA 51 before it is given. Montanide ISA 51 is an ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response in people, which helps the vaccine work better.

This study has two phases: Priming and Maintenance. During the Priming Phase, patients will get one dose of SurVaxM combined with Montanide ISA 51 through a subcutaneous injection (a shot under the skin) at the start of the study and every 2 weeks for 6 weeks (for a total of 4 doses). At the same time that patients get the SurVaxM/Montanide ISA 51 injection, they will also get a second subcutaneous injection of a medicine called sargramostim. Sargramostim is given close to the SurVaxM//Montanide ISA 51 injection and works to stimulate the immune system to help the SurVaxM/Montanide ISA 51 work more effectively.

If a patient completes the Priming Phase without severe side effects and his or her disease stays the same or improves, he or she can continue to the Maintenance Phase. During the Maintenance Phase, the patient will get a SurVaxM/Montanide ISA 51 dose along with a sargramostim dose about every 8 weeks for up to two years.

After a patient finishes the study treatment, the doctor and study team will continue to follow his/her condition and watch for side effects up to 3 years following the last dose of SurVaxM/Montanide ISA 51. Patients will be seen in clinic every 3 months during the follow-up period.","This is a multicenter pilot study of SurVaxM (SVN53-67/M57-KLH) for children and young adults with progressive or relapsed medulloblastoma, high grade glioma, ependymoma and newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.

Survivin (BIRC5) is an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein that is highly expressed in many cancers. Survivin's high level of expression in certain pediatric malignancies makes it an attractive molecular target for new therapies, including active specific vaccination-based immunotherapy.

The design of the SurVaxM vaccine employs several strategies to create an effective antitumor immunogen, including: 1) incorporation of multiple MHC class I epitopes, 2) peptide modification to enhance binding to certain MHC class I molecules, 3) cytokine helper support, and 4) antibody-mediated tumor cell killing. All of these effects would not be expected with the unmodified class-I restricted short survivin peptides employed in previously studied glioma vaccines.

There are no prior clinical trials of SurVaxM in pediatric patients; however, SurVaxM has been studied in several adult trials, including a phase I study conducted at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Following the single-institution phase I trial, a multicenter phase IIa trial (NCT024455557) was conducted in 63 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. All patients in this study underwent surgical resection of their tumors. Patients then underwent chemoradiation with temozolomide according to the Stupp protocol. This was followed by a one-month hiatus from chemotherapy, during which priming doses of SurVaxM were initiated. The priming phase of vaccination was then followed by initiation of standard adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide and maintenance doses of SurVaxM as an add-on to standard chemotherapy. There have been no regimen-limiting toxicities (RLT) or grade ≥ 3 SAE attributable to SurVaxM, with most toxicities being related to temozolomide. The most common AE was grade 1-2 injection site reaction with 2 patients experiencing Montanide-related granulomatous panniculitis with local skin ulceration at vaccine injection sites, both of which resolved. Humoral and survivin-specific CD8+ T cell responses were observed in almost all patients. Twelve-month overall survival (OS12) was 86% from first immunization and 93.4% from diagnosis. OS12 for meMGMT was 93.1% and unMGMT was 78% from first immunization. Median time to tumor progression (mPFS) was 13.9 months from diagnosis. Although not a randomized trial, these results are superior to overall survival reported in various studies in which patients received standard of care treatment for this disease. A randomized phase IIb clinical trial of standard therapy plus SurVaxM is currently being developed with intent for drug registration, if successful.

The primary objective of this trial is to assess the toxicity profile of SurVaxM in emulsion with Montanide plus sargramostim in children with relapsed or progressive medulloblastoma and high-grade glioma, ependymoma and non-recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma post-radiation therapy. Patients will be enrolled into three separate strata based on age and diagnosis. Enrollment will be staged to allow for safety evaluations between strata.

Each patient will receive 500 micrograms SurVaxM as a 1:1 mixture with Montanide ISA 51 in a water-in-oil emulsion. The SurVaxM-Montanide emulsion injection will be followed immediately by sargramostim (or biosimilar) given via a second separate subcutaneous injection in close proximity to the vaccine injection site. Patients will receive four injections administered over a 6-week period, followed by 14 days of follow-up, called the Priming Phase (8 weeks total). Beginning 8 weeks after the fourth priming dose, a maintenance dose of SurVaxM with Montanide ISA 51 may be given every 8 weeks (± 2 weeks) for two years or until an off-treatment criterion is met.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04978727,surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy; pediatric,Mixed,Primary,Post-Surgery

The primary endpoint of this study is safety/tolerability.

This supplement, PolyMVA, is a uniquely formulated combination of minerals, vitamins, and amino acids. The principle ingredient is the Palladium Lipoic Acid Complex (PdLA). There is no free alpha-lipoic acid or free palladium in Poly MVA; they are bound together (Garnett 1995, Krishnan and Garnett 2005). PolyMVA is both water and lipid soluble. It is uniquely arranged in a liquid crystal polymer structure, allowing it to store a great deal of energy, and thus serve as a semi-conductor. The overall function of this polymer is that it provides a unified redox reaction (accepts and donates charge), and acts as a highly effective energy-transferring molecule. It is able to rapidly and efficiently transfer electron charge to DNA, protecting non-cancerous cells from the oxidative damage of radiation and chemotherapy.

Over the past years neuroscientists from our institution have used tissue culture techniques to study the effects of PolyMVA (PdLA) on the apoptotic cell death cascade in cancer cells. The work was predicated on the Nobel Prize winning discovery by Dr. Otto Warburg that cancerous tumors are oxygen deficient and rely upon anaerobic metabolism for energy production. Malignant cells have thus adapted to function in a hypoxic environment; however, since anaerobic metabolism produces less energy per unit of fuel, tumor cells are less efficient at energy production than normal healthy cells. PolyMVA (PdLA) takes advantage of this metabolic situation. PolyMVA (PdLA), by transferring excess electrons to malignant cells (which are functioning in a limited oxygen environment), is responsible for the selective generation of free radicals within the mitochondrial membrane of malignant cells. Free radical generation in this region facilitates cytochrome c release, activation of the apoptotic cascade, and, ultimately, cancer cell death.

Furthermore, electrochemistry data and ischemia data from our institution both have elucidated that shuttled electrons do not go directly to DNA, but pass via the mitochondria. (This route was determined by competitively blocking the efficiency of PolyMVA (PdLA) with free alpha lipoic acid, which works at complex I of the mitochondria.) Therefore, electrons, en route to DNA, are shunted down the electron transport chain. The result: enhanced cellular energy in a non-malignant cell. (Clinically, this is a process which would not only benefit cancer patients who, as a result of toxic therapeutic regimens and cancerous invasion, are energy-depleted; but this would also benefit normal healthy subjects who experience fatigue, or, who are simply looking for an energy boost.)

Poly MVA not only functions as an energy-transferring molecule, but also as a free radical scavenger (it is able to quench radical species). It is the combination of these activities, which may benefit cells exposed to ischemic conditions. During an ischemic insult, Poly MVA has the ability to shuttle electrons from the plasma cell membrane to the mitochondria, and thus stabilize the vulnerable electron transfer chain. Additionally, its liquid crystal polymer activity has the ability to quench any radicals generated upon reperfusion. This non-toxic novel supplement may therefore serve as a potent anti-ischemia agent.

Hypothesis:

Eight teaspoon daily dosage of PolyMVA in grade IV astrocytoma patients is safe and well-tolerated.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01833273,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

The safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.

The goal of this Phase II part of this clinical research study is to learn if bevacizumab when given with or without vorinostat can help to control malignant gliomas. The safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.","Background

* Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. With optimal treatment, consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, median survival is 14.6 months. Most patients have evidence of tumor progression within one year of diagnosis despite treatment. At progression, treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective.
* Given the importance of angiogenesis in GBM, anti-angiogenic therapy is a promising strategy in recurrent GBM. Bevacizumab, the first angiogenesis inhibitor approved against cancer by FDA based on improved survival of advanced colon cancer patient, has recently been studied in the GBM.
* The present study aims to determine the potential of vorinostat, an HDAC inhibitor plus bevacizumab, versus bevacizumab alone, in an attempt to increase the anti-angiogenic effects of VEGF by blocking the evasive resistance by combination with vorinostat and to also not only provide the potential of the independent effects of both agents but also the potential for synergy.

Objectives

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat plus bevacizumab in adult patients with malignant glioma.
* To determine the efficacy of vorinostat plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV glioma (glioblastoma and gliosarcoma) as determined by progression free survival (PFS) using an adaptive randomization phase II trial design.

Eligibility

* Patients must have histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma or anaplastic glioma to be eligible for the Phase I component of this protocol. Anaplastic gliomas include anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant glioma NOS (not otherwise specified). Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a malignant glioma is made. Only patients with histologically proven or imaging proven recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be eligible for the Phase II component.
* Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression as determined by an MRI scan done prior to study entry which will be reviewed by the treating physician to confirm and document recurrence.
* No prior treatment with bevacizumab or Vorinostat

Design

The phase I component will assess the MTD of Vorinostat in combination with Bevacizumab. A conventional phase I design will be used and the MTD will be selected using a 3+3 accrual design at each dose level until MTD is determined. A maximum of 18 patients will be recruited to this component of the study.

The phase II component of the trial compares Bevacizumab to Vorinostat+ Bevacizumab in patients with recurrent GBM. The primary outcome is progression free survival. Patients will be randomized between the two arms using a Bayesian adaptive algorithm. Patients will be randomized fairly between the two arms at the start of the trial (for the first 20 patients). Thereafter, as the trial progresses and data accrue, the randomization will become unbalanced in favor of the treatment that, on average, has better results in terms of failure time. Therefore, each successive patient is more likely to receive the treatment with better results, on average. A minimum of 20 and a maximum of 90 patients will be accrued.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01266031,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

Secondary

* To characterize the safety and tolerability of erlotinib hydrochloride and sirolimus combination therapy in these patient populations.
* To characterize the single-dose and repeated-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of erlotinib hydrochloride (in serum) and sirolimus (in whole blood) combination therapy in these patient populations.

Participants will receive an egg powder enriched for antisecretory factor (AF), Salovum, or a placebo egg powder daily from 2 days before concomitant radio-chemo therapy or chemotherapy until 14 days after finalisation plus during adjuvant chemotherapy.The primary aims of are overall survival at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis","Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary brain tumor and also has the worst prognosis with a mean survival time below 1 year and a 5-year survival rate of less than 2%. AF is a 41kilodalton endogenous and essential protein with antisecretory and anti-inflammatory effects. Endogenous AF activity increases after exposure to bacterial toxins and endogenous triggers of inflammation. The active amino-terminal portion of AF has been synthesized as a 16 amino acid peptide (AF-16) and has been used in animal experimental studies. Salovum® is a product based on egg yolk powder B221® and contains high levels of AF. Salovum® is classified as food for special medicinal purposes (FSMP) by the European Union an din other countries.

Many tumors show elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) compared to the surrounding tissue due to vascular leakage, providing a barrier for drug uptake in solid tumors, as well as poor perfusion, resulting in hypoxia and relative resistance to radiochemotherapy.

AF-16 was reported to significantly reduce the IFP in xenotransplanted human glioblastoma by inhibiting an ionic pump, NKCC1, in the tumor tissue. Both Salovum® and AF-inducing specific processed cereals (SPC) prolonged survival in the same models. Systemic temozolomide treatment combined with AF inducing SPC completely blocked tumor growth in GBM xenografts. Likewise, SPC treatment abrogated 90% of pre-established syngeneic tumors in immune competent animals.

Intratumoral delivery of AF-16 potentiated the effect of intratumoral temozolomide in an experimental model of glioblastoma.

Mechanistically, it remains unclear whether AF's effect in tumor models is mediated through decrease of IFP and/or immunomodulation. Also, an effect on the complement system through modulation of circulating complement complexes with proteasome units has been proposed.

Salovum® has been administered to patients with various diseases as, inflammatory bowel disease, Mb Ménière and mastitis and traumatic brain injury without signs of any adverse effects.

In a completed phase1-2 trial in participants with primary gliobalstoma the add on of Salovum during concomitant radiochemotherapa was considered safe and feasible.

Patients diagnosed with high-grade glioblastomas typically experience a median survival period of less than 14 months. Presently, the standard treatment for glioblastoma involves surgical resection combined with postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with postoperative chemotherapy playing a pivotal role in enhancing patient prognosis. Temozolomide (TMZ), a cutting-edge oral alkylating agent known for its advantageous properties, including easy traversal of the blood-brain barrier, induces DNA alkylation in tumor cells, fostering apoptosis. Currently, it serves as a frontline medication for postoperative chemotherapy in glioblastoma. However, clinical resistance to TMZ chemotherapy significantly hampers its efficacy in later stages. We have recently discovered and validated that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA), derived from TMZ, can transform into 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide-5-phosphate (AICAR) in GBM cells. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) has been identified as the catalyst for the AICA reaction, generating AICAR. AICAR acts as an endogenous activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), fostering chemoresistance in glioblastoma through the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) competes effectively to inhibit HPRT1 activity, thereby impeding TMZ-induced AMPK activation and significantly heightening glioblastoma cell sensitivity to TMZ.

Your immune system helps guard your body from germs, viruses, and other threats. Although dendritic cells are very strong, the number of them in the body is not high enough to cause a powerful immune response; therefore, more DC are made in a laboratory with cells collected from an individual's blood.

In this study, we will make a vaccine that we hope will educate immune cells to target the pp65 antigen, a type of immune marker in GBM, thus resulting in what we call the pp65 DC vaccine. Use of a vaccine that activates your immune system is a type of immunotherapy. It is hoped that by giving the pp65 DC vaccine as a shot under the skin, the immune system will be activated to attack tumor cells in the brain while leaving normal cells alone.

In patient diagnosed with recurrence/progression glioblastoma (recGB) following prior therapy with surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide, cytotoxic salvage therapies resulted in a best overall response rate of 5 to 10%, 6-month PFS rates of 9% to 21%, and a median OS of 25 to 30 weeks.

Axitinib, a VEGFR-specific small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Tki) has demonstrated anti-tumor activity when evaluated as a mono-therapy and in combination with lomustine for the treatment of patients with recGB (EudraCT 2011-000900-16). Immunocytochemical profiling of the peripheral blood of recurrent GBM patients treated with axitinib or axitinib plus lomustine showed that axitinib treatment increases the number of naive CD8+ T cells and central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. There was also a reduction of TIM3 expression and an increased cytokine production in the patients treated with axitinib. Upon progression during axitinib treatment patients displayed an increased immune suppression with an increased number of Treg, an increased PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and a reduced T cell functionality.

Expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been correlated with a higher probability for respons to avelumab throughout different tumor types. Glioblastoma has been reported to expresses the PD-L1 ligand.

In preclinical mouse models we demonstrated that axitinib reduces the immune suppressive microenvironment through reduction of the suppressive capacity of monocytic MDSCs (both in intra-cranial as well as subcutaneous tumors). Moreover, it also increased the number of tumor-infiltrating T cells. When we combined axitinib with active immunotherapy in the form of CTLA4 blockade not only a supplementary reduction of the suppressive capacity of these monocytic MDSCs was found, but also a reduction of the intratumoral granulocytic MDSCs and an increased antigen-presenting function of intratumoral DCs (manuscript accepted for publication in High-grade gliomas of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by profound tumor related neo-angiogenesis, and intracranial perilesional edema.

The rational for combining avelumab with for the treatment of recGB is based on the potential of axitinib to normalize the glioblastoma associated neo-vasculature, counteracting the immunosuppressive role of VEGF in the tumor microenvironment and controlling intracranial edema. These features may result in a synergistic anti-tumor effect with the PD-L1 inhibitory mAb avelumab. In addition, axitinib may reduce the inflammatory edema related to the anti-tumor effect mediated by PD-L1 inhibition with avelumab.

Patients with recGBM often develop neurological symptoms related to perilesional edema. Corticosteroids are considered a standard of care for controlling intracranial edema in patients with glioblastoma. High dose corticosteroids however are known to be immunosuppressive and are likely to counteract the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy. Axitinib has the capacity to control recGBM associated edema of the brain. Out of the 32 patients who were treated with corticosteroids at baseline in the AxiG trial (EudraCT 2011-000900-16) 17 could lower and 5 could stop their steroids during treatment with axitinib.

To better characterize the safety and tolerability profile of PhOx430 given at the RP2D in three cohorts of patients affected by 1) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 2) triple-negative breast cancer, and 3) selected types of solid tumours.

DOSE EXPANSION'S SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

1. to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of PhOx430 at the RP2D.
2. to evaluate the antitumour activity of PhOx430 in the specific tumour types selected for the dose expansion cohorts.

   DOSE EXPANSIONS' EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:
3. to characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of PhOx430 on blood, urine and tumour samples collected before and after treatment;
4. to identify predictive response biomarkers by profiling responsive patterns.

STUDY DESIGN AND TREATMENT PLAN:

Dose Escalation Phase - STEP 1-2: a standard 3 + 3 design will be followed. PhOx430 will be administered orally twice a day (bid), at a 12-hour interval, continuously in cycles of 21 days. At each dose level (DL), at least three patients will be included and the first patient will be observed for at least 21 days before enrolling the following two.

Dose Escalation Phase - STEP 3 (Dosing-optimization Cohort): The implementation of this Dosing-optimization cohort (Step 3) was decided by the Protocol Steering Committee (PSC) based on clinical and pharmacokinetic data obtained in Steps 1 and 2. Six patients will be enrolled, who will be administered a flat dose of PhOx430 (1,200 mg by patients weighing ≥ 50 kg and of 600 mg by patients weighing \< 50 kg) orally thrice a day (tid) for 21 days, and then, starting from day 22, four times a day (qid), continuously in cycles of 21 days. The first patient will be observed after treatment start for at least 21 days before enrolling the following two. After the third patient is observed for 21 days after treatment start, three additional patients will be enrolled without waiting time between them. In case the daily dose tested with the tid schedule is not deemed safe, the flat dose of PhOx430 will be tested twice a day (bid).

Cohort Expansion Phase: in the cohort expansion phase, the safety profile of PhOx430 will be further characterized by testing the RP2D in three parallel cohorts of patients affected by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (cohort 1), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (cohort 2), and solid tumour types selected by the Protocol Steering Committee (PSC) on the basis of preclinical pharmacological data and of the antitumour activity observed during the Dose Escalation Phase if any (cohort 3), respectively. Cycles will be of 21 days.

ESTIMATED TRIAL DURATION and SAMPLE SIZE:

Dose Escalation Phase Step 1,2,3: approximately 1.5 years Expansion Phase: approximately 1.5 years. The end of trial is defined as 30 days after the last dose of the last enrolled patient.

The following numbers of patients are foreseen: up to 149 patients.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05495295,imaging,Adult,Metastatic,Unclear

However, the infiltrative nature of the malignant glioma tumor cells produces indistinct borders between normal and malignant tissues, and the lack of easily identifiable tumor margins confounds attempts at total resection. The investigators propose to identify the borders of malignant gliomas intraoperatively using oral 5-aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) which results in fluorescence of the malignant cells and thereby provide an opportunity for more complete tumor resection.

When exogenous 5-ALA is provided at increased concentration the tumor cells will become fluorescent under ultraviolet light. This feature identifies the tumor cells intraoperatively and facilitates complete resection.

Data collection will include measurement of dose-limiting toxicity, tumor fluorescence, and tumor density. Data analysis will evaluate toxicity, sensitivity, and specificity of 5-ALA.

Following completion of the phase 1 portion of this trial, an additional 14 subjects will be entered at the recommended phase 2 dose level in order to further define the above parameters at the recommended phase 2 dose level.","Specific Aims:

This study is intended to investigate the utility, safety and efficacy of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) induced brain tumor fluorescence during malignant brain tumor resection. Specifically this study is intended to:

Establish a safe dose for oral 5-ALA administration. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of 5-ALA mediated fluorescence for malignant glioma tissue in the brain.

Background and Significance:

There is a considerable body of literature that suggests that completeness of resection is a positive factor for longer term survival in individuals with malignant glioma. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to completely remove a malignant brain tumor because during surgery it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish tumor from normal brain. It would be very helpful if there would be some way to help the surgeon make this distinction. Malignant glioma tumor cells (more so than normal cells) contain the biosynthetic pathways to produce protoporphyrin from a naturally occurring amino acid, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). Protoporphyrin is the immediate precursor to hemoglobin (it is hemoglobin without the iron atom) and is fluorescent under blue light. When exogenous 5-ALA is provided at increased concentration, protoporphyrin concentration in the malignant cell increases at a rate far greater than normal brain cells and renders the malignant cell fluorescent red under blue light. This feature distinguishes the tumor cells from normal cells intraoperatively and facilitates complete resection.

Recent studies in Germany have confirmed the utility of pre-operative oral 5-ALA and intraoperative brain tumor fluorescence in aiding the resection of brain tumors in individuals with malignant brain tumors. These studies have led to oral 5-ALA to be approved for this indication by the European Medicines Agency, but oral 5-ALA has not been approved for this indication by the United States FDA. This proposal is a phase 1 and phase 2 trial that will hopefully lead to FDA approval of oral 5-ALA for intra-operative visualization of malignant brain tumors.

Experimental Plan and Methods:

In the phase 1 part of this proposed study, a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 19 patients will be administered oral 5-ALA 4 hours prior to surgery in cohorts of 3 at five escalating doses of 5-ALA (10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg/kg).

The following data will be collected:

* Dose-limiting toxicity data; i.e., nausea, vomiting, liver function, photo-sensitivity
* Tumor fluorescence assessed by neurosurgeon
* Tumor density from biopsies obtained by the neurosurgeon in will be assessed by neuropathology (Solid tumor, Tumor mixed infiltrating normal brain, No tumor)

This trial will evaluate:

* single dose toxicity of oral 5-ALA given pre-operatively;
* sensitivity and specificity of 5-ALA - Protoporphyrin IX (Pp IX) as an intraoperative fluorescent detection agent and aid for resection of tumor tissue remaining in the walls of the resection cavity of primary and recurrent malignant brain tumors;

Following completion of the phase 1 portion of this trial, an additional 14 subjects will be entered at the recommended phase 2 dose level in order to further define the above parameters at the recommended phase 2 dose level.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01128218,surgery,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

The treatment will be administered until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, lost to follow-up or death.

The entire study is expected to last approximately 40 months.","Diffuse malignant gliomas are the most common central nervous system (CNS) primary tumours in adults, characterized by poor prognosis and few treatment options. In the last 15 years, standard treatment consisting of surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ)-based chemotherapy has remained unchanged. New therapeutic approaches are urgently needed.

TMZ is a DNA-methylating chemotherapeutic agent with good CNS penetration. Its mechanism of action is increased by either gene promoter methylation or consumption of the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), an enzyme repairing chemotherapy-induced genome damages.

Alternative, intensified schedules of TMZ (dose-dense TMZ, dd-TMZ) can give patients an increased total dose of drugs per each cycle, progressively consuming MGMT and overcoming resistance of cancer cells to standard first-line schedule. They are usually used at disease recurrence, with a tolerable safety profile. For example, a clinical study testing the 7 day on / 7 day off schedule showed that MGMT activity in blood mononuclear cells decreased at day 8 and progressively recovered during the week-off. This may limit haematological toxicity.

The inhibition of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins, normally involved in genomic stability, may rationally improve TMZ efficacy. Switching off PARP molecules can block both base-excision repair (BER) system and Poly-ADP ribose-ylation of MGMT (a key process for its function), leading to an amplification in DNA damages. In the subset of Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1/2 mutant gliomas, the enzyme leads to 2-hydroxy-glutarate (2HG) accumulation in cancer cells. This onco-metabolite increases sensitivity to DNA damages by alkylating agents and induces a Breast Cncer gene(BRCA)-ness phenotype indeed. Considering all this, the use of PARP inhibitors seems promising even for these patients.

When compared to other PARP inhibitors, Niraparib has peculiar pharmacokinetics proprieties, such as higher volume of distribution (Vd) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. These characteristics lead to a progressive drug accumulation in brain and other body tissues with standard daily administration, reaching concentration well over that necessary for PARP inhibition. Overall, Niraparib can represent an ideal candidate to explore for treatment of malignant gliomas and a non-continuous administration may lead to a reduced bone marrow exposure, decreasing haematological toxicity without compromising anticancer activity.

Previous clinical experiences have already explored PARP inhibitors combined to TMZ in solid malignancies, with scarce tolerability mainly due to bone marrow exhaustion. In one small trial, a continuous administration of Niraparib in combination with standard schedule TMZ across several cohorts confirmed high rate of hematologic toxicities and interestingly showed signals of activity in glioblastoma (GBM).

Considering the peculiar pharmacokinetics proprieties of Niraparib and the recovery in MGMT activity described for dd-TMZ, investigator speculate that different schedules and doses of the two drugs (compared to the ones approved in clinical practice) may be explored to improve tolerability preserving the synergistic activity.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06258018,chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

This so called ""Warburg effect"" or the reliance of central nervous system (CNS) tumor cells on glucose utilization through glycolysis has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in cancer metabolism. Preclinically, reduced cerebral glucose via calorie restriction has been repeatedly associated with tumor reduction and improved survival in glioma animal models. Such work has led to several early clinical studies evaluating the ketogenic diet (KD) in patients with recurrent GBM.

The modified Atkins diet (MAD) is designed to provide a more palatable, less restrictive but effective alternative to the strict KD, particularly for adults. The MAD does not require inpatient admission for initial fast, weight of foods, or severe dietary restrictions and is generally well tolerated, easier to administer, and more practical for adults. The MAD lacks calorie restriction, an important component to dietary therapies in preclinical investigations. Emerging evidence also suggests that short term fasting may provide superior anti-cancer activity to long term calorie restriction and that these benefits have been observed without substantial weight loss that can be observed with longer term calorie restriction.

In glioma patients, a diet therapy that combines the broad clinical application of the MAD with the caloric impact of short-term intermittent fasting is therefore optimal. Moreover, initiation of this diet when the cancer has already undergone induction therapy and is clinically and radiographically stable, may provide the optimal time for metabolic intervention to prevent recurrence or progression.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02286167,,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

This study will also study how your body metabolizes (breaks down) PSMA ADC.","PSMA expression has been demonstrated in the tumor neovasculature of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) by immunohistochemical staining. Strong reactivity to the antibody component of PSMA ADC was observed in the endothelial cells of new tumor blood vessels in GBM. Since the endothelial cells are located on the luminal surface of blood vessels, PSMA ADC does not need to cross the blood brain barrier to reach its target. Following binding and internalization of PSMA ADC, the cytotoxic component of PSMA ADC will be released and destroy the neovasculature that supports tumor growth. Therefore, PSMA ADC may be an active treatment for GBM.

Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, has been shown to be effective in improving progression-free survival as a single agent. Thus PSMA ADC, which targets tumor angiogenesis by a mechanism different from that of bevacizumab, may be a novel therapeutic modality for GBM.

A phase 2 study of PSMA ADC is proposed for patients with GBM that have progressed after standard treatment that includes radiation, temozolomide and bevacizumab. A phase 1 study of PSMA ADC in prostate cancer is ongoing and a phase 2 dose level of 2.5 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks has been defined. Treatment after bevacizumab failure for patients with GBM is a major unmet medical need.

The interpretation of intraoperative images obtained in situ will be tested against conventional histologic evaluation of targeted biopsies from imaged tissue. The study team hypothesize that there will be a high degree of correlation between images obtained with the CONVIVO system and conventional histologic interpretation.,"The surgical resection of brain tumors is an integral component of modern neuro-oncology. . Extent of resection has been found to be associated with increased overall and progression free survival, with the greatest benefit occurring in the setting of a complete or gross total resection. Unfortunately, there are a number of obstacles unique to brain tumors that may limit the extent of resection. A number of advancements in neurosurgical oncology have emerged to improve the extent of tumor resection while decreasing operative morbidity and mortality. Confocal reflectance microscopy is a routine technique used to visualize tissues without fixation or staining used in classical histological techniques. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) is an optical fluorescence imaging modality used for imaging thick in vivo and ex vivo tissues. Clinically available confocal endomicroscopy systems contain lasers with precise excitation wavelengths and dichroic filters for detecting appropriate emission wave lengths. The studies completed to date do not evaluate the ability of confocal microscopy to discriminate between normal and abnormal tissue at the margins during surgical resection. This is the first of such in vivo feasibility studies that aims to demonstrate this claim of the CONVIVO system.

The images acquired with the CONVIVO system following administration of fluorescein will be compared to conventional histologic specimens from corresponding biopsies. This is a planned single center study. This study is designed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the CONVIVO system compared with gold-standard histopathology in tissue that has already been identified for resection. The device will not be used to inform surgical decision making, nor will tissue that would not otherwise be resected be biopsied for research purposes.

This study will rely on study investigators, all physicians at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, to identify subjects. Written consent is required for participation in the study.. There are no specific medical risks to patients associated with the use of CONVIVO. It is not anticipated that there are immediate or direct benefits to patients participating in this study. The CONVIVO imaging data acquired during the procedure will be initially stored on the device's hard drive and later securely uploaded to an encrypted Dartmouth-Hitchcock server. Patients will have the ability to maintain their privacy with minimal disruption or contact by the study team. Additionally, the PI or other investigators will have interactions with the patient as part of their routine clinical care.

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temsirolimus when administered with temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

II. Assess and describe the adverse events associated with this regimen in these patients.

III. Evaluate the early response to therapy in these patients using an automated morphological MRI change detector and physiological MRI techniques, including diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and chemical shift imaging.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the inhibition status of mTOR signaling pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients treated with this regimen.

II. Identify potential pharmacokinetic interactions between temozolomide and temsirolimus.

III. Correlate, preliminarily, survival, progression-free survival, and response with pre-treatment tumor tissue molecular markers in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

GROUP 1: (temsirolimus with radiation and temozolomide) Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes once weekly. Beginning 7-10 days later, patients also receive oral temozolomide daily and undergo concurrent 3-D conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Patients are evaluated 4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Patients with stable or responding disease proceed to adjuvant therapy. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temsirolimus until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

GROUP 2: (radiation and temozolomide) Patients receive oral temozolomide daily and undergo concurrent 3-D conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Patients are evaluated 4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Patients with stable or responding disease proceed to adjuvant therapy.

ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Some patients undergo blood collection for immune monitoring and translational/pharmacologic studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00316849,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

These samples will be taken at the time of routine standard of care lab work.

Based on prior clinical trials evaluating niacin extended release formulation for the management of dyslipidaemias there is vast experience on dose escalation of niacin. One of the main side effects is flushing that is ameliorated by escalating doses in intervals no shorter than 4 weeks and usually decreases with time.

Following this schema, there is no increase in dose coinciding with TMZ while administered in a 5/28 days schedule (given daily for 5 days of each 28-day cycle).

After written informed consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized for an awake craniotomy (AC) (+/-123 patients) or craniotomy under general anesthesia (GA) (+/-123 patients), with 1:1 allocation ratio. Under GA the amount of resection of the tumour has to be performed within safe margins as judged by the surgeon during surgery. The second group will be operated with an awake craniotomy procedure where the resection boundaries for motor or language functions will be identified by direct cortical and subcortical stimulation. After surgery, the diagnosis of GBM will have to be histologically confirmed. If GBM is not histologically confirmed, patients will be considered off-study and withdrawn from the study. These patients will be followed-up according to standard practice. Thereafter, patients will receive the standard treatment with concomitant Temozolomide and radiation therapy and standard follow up. Total duration of the study is 5 years. Patient inclusion is expected to take 4 years. Follow-up is 1 year after surgery. Statistical analysis, cost benefit analysis and article writing will take 3 months.","Rationale Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) or Astrocytoma's grade IV (WHO) are devastating tumors with one of the worst prognoses in oncology. Extending resection improves survival in patients with GBM. Surgery of GBM nowadays is usually performed under general anesthesia (GA) and resections are not as aggressive as possible, due to the chance of seriously damaging the patient with a rather low life expectancy. A surgical technique optimizing resection of the tumor in eloquent areas but preventing neurological deficits is necessary to improve survival and quality of life in these patients. Awake craniotomy (AC) with the use of cortical and subcortical stimulation is an alternative surgical technique that is standardly implemented in surgery for low grade glioma, but not yet for GBM. AC has shown to increase resection percentage and preserve quality of life in low grade glioma (LGG) and could be of important value in the surgery of GBM.

Objective The study is performed to increase safety and efficacy during surgery in patients with GBM in eloquent areas. This study will compare awake craniotomy with surgery under general anesthesia for patients with GBM near or in eloquent areas. Primary end points are: 1) Proportion of patients with NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) deterioration at 6 weeks post- surgery, where deterioration is defined as at least one point increase in total NIHSS score compared to baseline. 2) Proportion of patients without residual contrast-enhancing tumour on postoperative MRI. Secondary end points are: 1) Health related quality of life (HRQoL) at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after operation. 2) Progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months after operation. 3) Overall survival (OS) at 12 months after operation. 4) Frequency and severity of Serious Adverse Effects in each group: Infections, intracranial bleeding, epilepsy, aphasia, paresis/paralysis in arms or/and legs. Also, a cost benefit analysis will be performed.

Study design The trial is set up as a multicenter randomized controlled study. The study will include 246 patients in 5 neurosurgical centers in the Netherlands. Patients with GBM in eloquent areas on diagnostic MRI will be selected by the neurosurgeons according to the eligibility criteria. After informed consent the patient will be randomized for awake craniotomy (AC) or regular craniotomy under general anesthesia (GA) with 1:1 allocation ratio. After surgery, only patients with histologically proven GBM will continue with the study. Patients in whom no GBM could not be proven histologically, will be considered off-study. Thereafter, patients will receive the standard treatment with concomitant Temozolomide and radiation therapy and standard follow up. Total duration of the study is 5 years. Patient inclusion is 4 years. Follow-up is 1 year.

Assessment of response and progression is made through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, which is typically obtained within one month after completion of radiation therapy and then every two months during adjuvant temozolomide to assess disease status1. With the available standard of care, the median overall survival of patients with glioblastoma remains very low - approximately 10 to 12 months2.

The poor prognosis with GBM is a result of an absence of early detection and ineffective treatment options. The proposed exploratory pilot project attempts to addresses the problem of accurate tumor progression monitoring in GBM through the development of a drug biomarker that monitors spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) activity. SSAT1 is an important enzyme involved in polyamine regulation in the cell. As polyamines are essential for tumor proliferation, SSAT1 is over-expressed in many different cancers, as shown in a number of non-clinical trials3,4,5. These trials provide a rationale for our project: if SSAT1 is overexpressed in cancers including glioblastoma, then a substrate of SSAT1 could serve as a biomarker for determining the cellular activity of SSAT1. An effective substrate is amantadine, and following its acetylation by SSAT1, N-acetyl-amantadine levels excreted in the blood and urine samples of patients with glioblastoma could be used to indicate the presence of upregulation of SSAT1, and therefore, indicative of cancer. Recently published clinical trials involving investigators here at University of Manitoba and CancerCare Manitoba have reported a method for assessing tumor progression in lung and breast cancer patients based on acetyl- amantadine levels in blood and urine6,7,8. The assay is predicated on the selective acetylation of the drug amantadine by SSAT1. Published studies indicate increases in acetyl-amantadine in blood and urine from patients receiving a single oral dose of amantadine was predictive of tumor burden. Tappia et.al.7 reported that human cancer is associated with high urinary concentration of acetyl-amantadine with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) for acetyl-amantadine demonstrated to be 0.689 (CI: 0.591-0.786, 95%) in lung cancer and 0.717 (CI: 0.577-0.858, 95%) for breast cancer.

Given the use of acetyl-amantadine as an early biomarker for lung and breast cancer, the present study protocol examines the extent to which acetyl-amantadine levels in blood and urine can be used to detect glioblastoma progression, particularly tumor recurrence which happens in the majority of patients and is considered inevitable after a median survival time of 32 - 36 weeks1. There are currently no studies that have attempted to determine the diagnostic value of acetyl-amantadine in glioblastoma patients, and therefore, this would be a pilot project. Under this protocol, patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (newly or recurrent) who are following the standard of care (surgical resection and radiation/chemotherapy) will be enrolled in the study. An initial assessment of the participant's baseline acetyl-amantadine levels in blood will be determined at the first visit. Thereafter, participants will be administered a standard 200 mg dose of the Health Canada approved drug amantadine at every visit in which MRI based imaging assessments are being performed (typically, every 8 - 12 weeks). Blood and urine samples will be taken at each visit to assay for acetyl-amantadine levels. These resulting acetyl-amantadine levels will be correlated with MRI based image findings to determine the extent to which this biomarker can be used for treatment monitoring in glioblastoma patients.

While the hypothesis is that acetyl-amantadine levels in blood or urine can be used to track tumor progression, an increase in acetyl-amantadine level would not indicate per se what type of tumor was present. For this reason, a metabolic profile on blood and urine samples collected from glioblastoma patients will be performed, to determine if there is a metabolic signature that can be established for glioblastoma.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04530006,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that uses the immune system as a tool to seek out and destroy abnormal cells. Immunotherapy requires that the immune system be working properly. Arginine is a normal component of protein (an amino acid) that we all consume in foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products and that our bodies can make. Arginine helps the immune system function normally. Recent research has shown that certain types of brain tumors decrease the amount of arginine in the body leading to impaired immune system function.

(Phase II)

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of cediranib followed by a phase II study.

Patients begin study treatment within 21-42 days after craniotomy or 14-21 days after stereotactic biopsy.

PHASE Ib:

CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients receive cediranib orally (PO) once daily and oral temozolomide once daily for 6 weeks. Within 2-6 hours of dosing, patients undergo concurrent intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Cediranib monotherapy: Patients receive cediranib PO once daily for 4 weeks (weeks 7-10). Cediranib and temozolomide monthly therapy: Patients receive cediranib PO once daily for 24 weeks (weeks 11-34) and temozolomide once daily, 5 days a week in weeks 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, and 31. Cediranib monotherapy: Patients receive a fixed-dose of cediranib once daily for 24 weeks (weeks 35-58).

PHASE II:

CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients receive cediranib PO at the recommended phase II dose determined in phase Ib, temozolomide PO, and undergo concurrent IMRT as in phase Ib (weeks 1-6). Cediranib monotherapy: Patients receive cediranib PO (at the recommended phase II dose determined in phase Ib) once daily for 4 weeks (weeks 7-10). Cediranib and temozolomide monthly therapy: Patients receive cediranib PO (at the recommended phase II dose determined in phase Ib) once daily for 24 weeks (weeks 11-34) and temozolomide once daily, 5 days a week in weeks 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, and 31. Cediranib monotherapy: Patients receive a fixed-dose of cediranib once daily for 24 weeks (weeks 35-58).

Patients undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and periodically during study. Blood samples are measured for tumstatin, as well as other well established biomarkers, including VEGF-A, -D, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2, sICAM1, sVCAM1, PlGF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, thrombospondin-1, and IL-8 by electrochemiluminescence detection. Circulating endothelial cell (CEC) assays are evaluated to assess the kinetics of CECs and progenitor cells prior to and during antiangiogenic therapy with cediranib and chemoradiotherapy. Urine samples are collected for proteomic analyses to evaluate serial change of growth factors such as VEGF and PlGF and of matrix metalloproteinases in response to treatment with cediranib. Archival tumor tissue is collected for analysis of tumor microvascular density, basement membrane and pericyte coverage, angiopoietin-1 and -2 expression, tumor cell proliferation, and apoptosis by immunostaining methods and immunoenzyme techniques.

Patients also undergo dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI and T2-weighted or perfusion-weighted MRI at baseline and periodically during study to monitor antiangiogenic effect on tumor vasculature through parameters reflecting both tumor perfusion and permeability; and diffusion tensor imaging to measure degree of water diffusion and fractional anisotropy. A subset of patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) periodically to monitor antiangiogenic effects on glucose utilization.

The primary questions the trial seeks to answer are:

* Can Salovum® and SPC® flakes have effect on clinical symptoms of tumor-induced cerebral edema?
* Can Salovum® and SPC® flakes induce regression of radiological edema in tumor-induced cerebral edema Additionally, the study will investigate the impact of Salovum® and SPC® flakes in steroid refractory, steroid naïve cerebral edema and type of barin tumor

Researchers will:

Evaluate edema change from baseline by MRI after 14 days Evaluate neurological and cognitive symptoms Register dose of steroid medications

Participants will:

* Ingest Salovum® 11g three times daily for 14 days, thereafter tapered during 14 days
* Ingest SPC® flakes 1g/kg daily from day 7","Background and Rationale Both primary and secondary brain tumors malignant but also benign meningiomas can induce cerebral edema . The edema can cause several nerurologic and cognitive symptoms which affect both performance and quality of life. Cerebral edema can be treated with high dose corticosteroids but witj substantial side effects. Alternative less toxic therapies are warranted.

Antisecretory factor (AF) is a crucial 41 kDa endogenous protein initially identified for its ability to inhibit experimental diarrhea. The active amino-terminal segment of AF has been synthesized into a 16-amino acid peptide (AF-16) and utilized in animal studies. Salovum®, a product based on the egg yolk powder B221®, contains high levels of AF and is classified as a ""food for special medical purposes"" by the European Food Safety Agency. It is available over-the-counter in Swedish pharmacies. Specially processed cereals (SPC®) have been shown to induce circulating AF derived peptides after ingestion.

Many tumors, including glioblastoma, exhibit higher interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) than surrounding tissues, potentially hindering chemotherapy penetration in systemic treatments and possibly increasing excretion during intratumoral treatments.

In head injury models, AF has been effective in reducing elevated intracranial pressure and improving functional outcomes. Similarly, AF has demonstrated a significant reduction in intracranial pressure and increased survival rates in an experimental model of herpes encephalitis. Preliminary results from our studies indicate that treatment with antisecretory factor in patients with severe traumatic head injuries reduces intracranial pressure and improves treatment outcomes. Since Salovum® is not classified as a drug, clinical trials have only required ethics approval.

AF is an endogenous protein, and no antibody formation has been observed when administered to humans. Despite being administered to hundreds of patients, no side effects have been reported. Egg yolk allergy is a contraindication, though no cases of triggered allergies have been documented.

In mouse models of malignant brain tumors, AF-16, Salovum® , or SPC® have been shown to lower interstitial fluid pressure and enhance the efficacy of both systemic and intratumoral temozolomide treatment. AF-16 also exhibits immunomodulatory effects on myeloid cells in vitro and on the secretion of immunomodulatory substances from tumor cells. It remains unclear whether AF's effects in tumor models are due to its antisecretory or immunomodulatory properties, or if the former is a result of the latter. Modulation of circulating complement complexes with proteasome units has also been suggested as a potential mechanism.

Details of Trial Participants with clinical and radiological signs of cerebral edema with diagnosis of primary or secondary malignant brain tumors or meningioma will be asked for informed consent to participate in the trial. Both patients with steroid naïve edema (in newly diagnosed participants) and steroid refractory edema (participants on steroid medication but with severe side effects or insuffiscient effect) will be recruited.

Participants will steroid naïve edema will be followed daily as in-patients and if no effect is found after 3 days the trial intervention will be abandoned and steroids will be initiated by the discretion of the responsible physician. Patients with steroid refractory cerebral edema will be evaluated after 7 days and if no effect is found the trial intervention will be abandoned and steroids will be initiated or increased in dose by the discretion of the responsible physician.

Participants will be evaluated with NANO scale for neurological symptoms, MOCA scale for cognitive symptoms and ECOG for performance.

MRI including T2 and FLAIR sequences will be performed at basline and at 14 (steroid naïve participants) or 28 days (steroid refractory participants). Edema volume and edema index will be calcualted frpm MRI images.

In both groups the patients will offered SPC® flakes from day 7. if Salovum® has shown an effect. After day 14 Salovum will be gradually tapered during 14 days.

Statistical analysis plan The oedema volume, oedema index , ECOG, MOCA and NANO scores are compared before and after treatment with Wilcoxon signed rank test (non-parametric data, paired observations).

The data will also be analyzed graphically and descriptively. All statistical analyses will be performed using R-project (https://www.r-project.org).

Ethical Considerations Glioblastoma carries a grim prognosis. Antisecretory factor has shown promising results in combination with chemotherapy in experimental models of human and mouse brain tumors. A clinical open phase 2 trial has demonstrated the safety and feasibility of this treatment, with no reported side effects from Salovum®. As with all studies involving serious and fatal diseases, there is an ethical consideration regarding the hope for treatment efficacy.

Bortezomib depletes the MGMT enzyme, restoring the tumour´s susceptibility to Temozolomide, if the chemotherapy is administered in the precise schedule when the MGMT enzyme is depleted. Additionally, Bortezomib inhibits the growth of tumour cells by blocking autophagy flux. Temozolomide causes genotoxic stress in cancer cells that in turn respond by inducing protective processes such as autophagy. If both autophagy and MGMT DNA repair enzyme are blocked a priori, the efficacy of Temozolomide will be enhanced. Thus, pre-treating the tumour with Bortezomib prior to administration of Temozolomide leads to DNA repair enzyme depletion and blockade of autophagy-induced survival signals.

DWI is a non-invasive MRI modality that has demonstrated an ability to predict for a response to radiation therapy in the primary treatment of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). PWI is one collection of measures that includes dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) enhancement and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. The latter methods of MRI-adapted radiotherapy allow the opportunity to direct high-dose radiation to areas most likely to harbor resistant tumor while avoiding regions having a low likelihood of future recurrence. Multiple MRI sequences have been developed and validated that may identify high-risk areas in patients with High-grade glioma (HGG) and the ability to acquire multiple sequential time points creates an opportunity for dynamic radiotherapy that has not previously been explored. The current standard of care in radiotherapy does not incorporate any additional neuroimaging data.

This study hypothesizes that pre- and mid-treatment advanced imaging with (DWI) and (PWI) in patients with HGG can be used to generate an adaptive radiotherapy boost volume that correlates with areas of future recurrence and that this volume has a higher spatial correlation relative to the current standard of care.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06108206,imaging,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

The device is an experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic treatment of patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) using alternating electric fields (termed TTFields).","PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:

The effect of the electric fields generated by the NovoTTF-100A device (TTFields) has been tested in two pilot trials in humans. The data from these trials suggest NovoTTF-100A may improve time to disease progression and overall survival of recurrent GBM patients. Although the number of patients in the pilot trials is small, The FDA has determined that the data gathered so far warrant testing of NovoTTF-100A treatment as a possible therapy for patients with recurrent GBM.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:

Patients with GBM whose disease has recurred or progressed despite standard treatment (Surgery, radiation therapy, Temozolomide treatment) and meet all of the requirements for participation in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

1. Treatment with the NovoTTF-100A device, or
2. Treatment with the best standard of care practiced at each of the participating centers.

If assigned to the best standard of care group, patients will receive a chemotherapeutic agent chosen based on their prior treatments and the standard of care practiced at each treating center.

If assigned to the NovoTTF-100A group, the patients will be treated continuously for as long as their disease is stable or regressing. NovoTTF-100A treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrodes on the head. Electrode placement will require shaving of the scalp before treatment. After an initial short hospitalization (24 hours) patients will be released to continue treatment at home where they can maintain their regular daily routine.

During the trial, regardless of whether assigned to the NovoTTF-100A treatment group or the best standard of care group, patients will need to return once every month the hospital outpatient clinics where they will be examined by a physician and undergo routine laboratory examinations. These routine visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing. After progression, if such occurs, patients will need to return once per month for two more months to the outpatient clinic for similar follow up examinations.

During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically. Additionally, routine blood tests and ECG will be performed. A routine MRI of the head will be performed at baseline and after 2, 4 and 6 months. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.

SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:

Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.

Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues. TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200 thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.

The breakthrough finding made by NovoCure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of electric charge.

As a result of these two effects, cancer tumor growth is slowed and can even reverse after continuous exposure to TTFields.

Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach.

In conclusion, TTField hold the promise of serving as a brand new cancer treatment with very few side effects and promising affectivity in slowing or reversing this disease.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00379470,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Sitagliptin is an investigational drug for this condition that works by inhibiting an enzyme called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), which MDSCs rely on to enter the brain and function. While sitagliptin is FDA-approved for diabetes treatment, its use in glioblastoma is investigational (experimental).","The glioblastoma microenvironment is well known to be immunosuppressive. One mechanism of immunosuppression involves systemic and local accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that inhibit cytotoxic immune cell populations and contribute to immune suppression. Glioblastoma(GBM) patients have increased circulating MDSCs compared to lower grade glioma patients, and GBM patients with a better prognosis have reduced MDSCs in their tumors as well as in their peripheral circulation. A trial (NCT02669173) performed at the Cleveland Clinic demonstrated that pre-surgical anti-MDSC therapy (capecitabine) was associated with reduced circulating MDSCs and increased cytotoxic immune infiltration in tumor tissue. This proof-of-principle pilot study demonstrated that targeting MDSCs in patients can attenuate tumor-induced immunosuppression. Subsequent work at the Cleveland Clinic demonstrated that MDSCs relied on dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) for entry into the brain and overall MDSC function. Screening for a DPP-4 inhibitor identified sitagliptin as a good inhibitor that has limited toxicity with efficacy in pre-clinical models. Investigators hypothesize that treating GBM patients with sitagliptin will deplete circulating MDSCs and reduce their entry into the brain, reversing systemic and intratumoral immunosuppression. To test this hypothesis, investigators plan a ""window of opportunity"" clinical trial to evaluate the safety and biological impact of sitagliptin treatment in patients with recurrent grade 4 glioma undergoing clinically indicated surgical resection. For this trial, investigators will enroll 48 patients; 36 will undergo presurgical treatment with sitagliptin and 12 with no presurgical treatment.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a cancer of the brain. Current survival rates for people with GBM are poor; survival ranges from 5.2 months to 39 months. Most tumors come back within months or years after treatment, and when they do, they are worse: Overall survival drops to less than 10 months. No standard treatment exists for people whose GBM has returned after radiation therapy.

Objective:

To find a safe schedule for using radiation to treat GBM tumors that returned after initial radiation treatment.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older with grade 4 GBM that returned after initial radiation treatment.

Design:

Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. A sample of tumor tissue may be collected.

Participants will undergo re-irradiation planning: They will wear a plastic mask over their head during imaging scans. These scans will pinpoint the exact location of the tumor. This spot will be the target of the radiation treatments.

Participants will undergo radiation treatment 4 times per week. Some people will have this treatment for 3 weeks, some for 2 weeks, and some for 1 week. Blood tests and other exams will be repeated at each visit.

Participants will complete questionnaires about their physical and mental health. They will answer these questions before starting radiation treatment; once a week during treatment; and at intervals for up to 3 years after treatment ends.

Participants will have follow-up visits 1 month after treatment and then every 2 months for 6 months. Follow-up clinic visits will continue up to 3 years. Follow-ups by phone or email will continue an additional 2 years.","Background:

* Although survival of glioblastoma (GBM) has improved using standard of care chemoradiation, outcomes are still poor. Most patients will recur within months to years, in or adjacent to their previous treatment field.
* There is no consensus standard of care for patients with recurrent GBM. Re-resection is recommended, if possible, to improve symptoms and decrease tumor volume. However, this treatment option is possible only in a minority of patients, and for these patients re-irradiation has emerged as a possible treatment.
* Modern radiation therapy (RT) techniques allow delivery of re-irradiation while minimizing the dose to previously treated organs at risk (OAR) within the radiation field.
* Data from a recently completed clinical trial at our center (16-C-0081, NCT02709226) suggests that the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of re-irradiation in 350 cGy fractions is 4200 cGy.

Objective:

-To determine the maximum tolerated dosage of daily re-irradiation in participants with recurrent Grade 4 gliomas

Eligibility:

* A histologic diagnosis of GBM, gliosarcoma, or transformation, from a lower grade to a grade 4 brain tumor.
* Previous glioma irradiation to curative-intent doses.
* Age \>= 18.
* Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) \>= 70.

Design:

* This is a single center phase I trial using a '3 plus 3' design and a three (3) dose level hypofractionation schema to enroll a maximum of 21 evaluable participants.
* Prior to radiation therapy, participants will undergo laboratory evaluations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a treatment planning computed tomography (CT), a neurocognitive function assessment, and patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires.
* RT will be administered daily 4 days a week for 1, 2, or 3 weeks in the Radiation Oncology Branch, NCI, at NIH. Radiation will be delivered on consecutive days, 4 fractions per week via a linear accelerator using 6 megavoltage (MV) photons or greater.
* Follow-up visits following RT are planned at 1 month, every 2 months for years 1-2, and every 3 months for year 3. These visits will be stopped earlier in case of progression. After progression or 3 years of follow-up, participants will be followed remotely for survival

Surgery, chemoradiotherapy (temozolomide TMZ) and then adjuvant TMZ is the standard treatment. But, most patients relapse in a median time of 8-9 months; the median overall survival (OS) ranged from 15 to 18 months.

Some frail patients received hypofractionated radiation and concomitant and adjuvant TMZ. For some, the radiation dose is not optimal. Moreover, recurrences develop mainly in the initial tumor site. These two reasons justify increasing the dose. To limit the movements of these fragile patients, the method consists of increasing the dose without increasing the number of sessions by using the Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) which increases the dose in targeted volumes while the rest of the volume receives a minimum dose. A phase I trial showed the possibility of increasing the dose in SIB up to 80 Gy in a part of the GBM enhanced on MRI.

FDOPA PET detects certain more aggressive tumor areas, areas likely to recur. Integrating them into the SIB seems appropriate. A phase II trial showed the interest of SIB guided by FDOPA PET in terms of progression-free survival but without impact on OS. This study differed from the one the investigators propose, because a dose and conventional fractionation, identical to that of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/National Cancer Information Center (NCIC/EORTC) protocol were delivered, the gliomas were unmethylated MGMT, less likely to respond. Studies with SIB and hypofractionation are often retrospective and for others, hypofractionation was debatable and the dose increase was not based on PET capture but on MRI. However, a prospective phase II study, with SIB and hypofractionation, not integrating FDopa PET has demonstrated the relevance of SIB.

In this project, the investigators propose to use the integrated boost technique (SIB) guided by PET FDOPA to increase the radiation dose in GBM, in patients either fragile and partially operated, or only biopsied and for whom the prognosis is the most pejorative.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05653622,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

Dendritic cells are a small group of cells that belong to the white blood cell population. These cells are responsible for letting the immune system know that something foreign, like bacteria or a tumor, is in the body. Dendritic cells help the body ward off disease by alerting the immune system. In previous clinical trials, brain tumor cells called astrocytoma tumor cells and glioblastoma tumor cells were taken from the tumor that was removed during surgery. The brain tumor cells were then placed into a solution in the laboratory that made them grow. Certain parts of the brain tumor's proteins (peptides) were removed from the growing tumor cells and mixed together with the dendritic cells in the blood taken from a vein. This combination of dendritic cells and brain tumor peptides were injected into the patient's skin, like a vaccination. This process is similar to that used in vaccinations. The patients were given three and four injections of dendritic cells mixed with the tumor peptides over the course of a twenty-eight day period.

In this study, the proteins that are manufactured and known to be associated with brain cancers will be mixed with the dendritic cells obtained during leukopheresis (a procedure in which the dendritic cells are separated from the patients' blood). They will then undergo three vaccinations along with follow up clinic visits (which include evaluations and laboratory tests) to check their status.

The investigators learned that it was possible to generate an immune response in a subset of patients with malignant glioma. In addition, these cells were able to reach the brain and kill brain tumor cells. The survival of patients in this study was prolonged when compared to historical controls.

NCT01956734,Phase I Trial of Combination of DNX-2401 (Formerly Named Delta-24-RGD) Oncolytic Adenovirus With a Short Course of Temozolomide for Treatment of Glioblastoma at First Recurrent,COMPLETED,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,31,ESTIMATED,"Sonia Tejada, MD, PhD (Clinica Universidad de Navarra)",2013-09,2017-03,2015-12,"Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Universidad de Navarra","DNAtrix, Inc.",Glioblastoma Multiforme; Recurrent Tumor,DNX2401 and Temozolomide,18 years,75 years,ALL,"Phase I trial, unicentric, uncontrolled. Intratumoral injection or intramural (into the resected tumor cavity) of DNX2401 into brain tissue will be followed by up to two 28 - day cycles of oral temozolomide (TMZ) in schedule of 7 days on/7 days off to evaluate safety of the combination. Completion of two full cycles of TMZ will be dependent upon tolerance and toxicity.

The rationale in using the virus with chemotherapy begins with the lessons learned in many clinical trials in glioblastoma (GBM) about both the great difficulty of treating this disease with monotherapy and the limitations of the therapeutic virus. The best clinical results in recent years have been achieved with combinations of multiple therapeutics efforts, including, maximum resection and chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies.

There are very strong preclinical data about the synergy of DNX-2401 and TMZ proposed in our trial design. The dose-dense schemes of TMZ like the one we will use, have been developed with the aim to saturate o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT). The published results to date have shown reasonable toxicity albeit with modest efficacy' these schemes are now in phase III trials. In addition, autophagy triggered by TMZ could help viral replication in the tumor cells 11.

The last argument in favor of this virus + TMZ combination is the proved efficacy in killing GBM tumor stem cells. In vitro and animals models have shown this combination is much more effective that any of the treatments alone against GBM stem cells and the tumors derived from them.",DNX2401 will be injected after stereotactic biopsy reveals intraoperative pathology confirming the presence of recurrent glioblastoma.

One of the main reasons accounting for the dismal prognosis would attribute to lack of active therapeutic regimens at recurrence.

Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against cardinal angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has recently shown efficacy for recurrent GBM, and has been approved in Japan, thereby being a standard care for recurrent GBM. Since there is no effective drugs or regimens developed at bevacizumab failure, insertion of another active drug prior to bevacizumab induction would enhance survival time for patients with recurrent GBM.

In Japan, there are currently only few chemotherapeutic agents approved and available for GBM. Among them rechallenge with alternating dosing of TMZ have shown certain efficacy with acceptable toxicities for patients with TMZ-pretreated recurrent GBM, thus being a good candidate for the regimen used prior to bevacizumab at recurrence.

The present proposal of sequential administration of dose dense TMZ (7/14d) followed by bevacizumab wishes to define a new standard of care for recurrent disease and hopes to identify the subgroups of patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma that respond particularly well to dose-dense temozolomide regimens.

Surgical resection plays a critical role in the treatment, with the extent of resection significantly impacting patient outcomes. Historical approaches to surgical resection have evolved, moving from radical strategies to more conservative ones that aim to preserve normal brain function while removing the tumor as completely as possible. Recent studies have suggested that increasing the extent of surgical resection, particularly along the T2 FLAIR border rather than the traditional T1-enhanced border, can significantly improve patient prognosis. There is, however, a lack of consensus on the optimal surgical approach, and the heterogeneity of tumors presents challenges in standardizing surgical strategies. Extended resection has been shown to prolong survival, and novel intraoperative molecular diagnostics have emerged to improve accuracy in tumor classification and prognosis. Building on these advancements, a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial is proposed to evaluate the efficacy of sub-lobectomy in treating IDH wild-type/TERTp-mutant glioblastoma, aiming to improve evidence levels and establish standardized surgical practices for this devastating disease.","Glioblastoma is the most prevalent and aggressive type of primary malignant brain tumor\[1\]. Treatment options are limited and often include surgical resection followed by radiation therapy or electric field therapy\[2\]. Prognosis is very poor, with median progression-free survival of only 12 months and median overall survival of less than 18 months. The 5-year survival rate is a mere 12% \[3\].

Surgical resection is fundamental to treating patients with glioblastoma, and the extent of resection directly impacts patient prognosis \[4\]. Professor William Stewart Halsted, a renowned surgeon, historically championed ""radical"" surgical resection as a means of controlling tumours \[5\]. Nevertheless, the majority of neurosurgeons disagreed with this view because of the disruption to normal brain function caused by extreme surgery. However, in 1928, Professor Walter Dandy reported five patients with gliomas who underwent right hemispherectomy \[6\]. These patients showed no significant neurological impairment except for left hemiparesis. Even though no grave complications arise from the complete resection of the nondominant hemisphere, it did not seem to enhance the patients' prognosis either. Only one out of these five patients survived for 3.5 years, and eventually, all of them passed away due to gliomas. After this, the radical surgical strategy of enlarging the resection margin around gliomas was challenged, and neurosurgeons aimed to achieve total resection of imaging gliomas, based on the principle of removing tumour tissue with an abnormal signal on MRI while preserving normal brain function.

Notably, with respect to the complete surgical removal of glioblastoma, the T1-enhanced borders of MRI imaging were commonly used as a criterion in the past. However, various retrospective studies reveal that increasing the extent of surgical resection significantly improves patient prognosis (median survival from 9.8 to 15.2 months) \[7\]. However, a recent study conducted retrospectively discovered that resection along the T2 FLAIR border advanced the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma even further compared to resection along the T1 enhancing border (median survival from 11.6 to 31.7 months) \[8\]. Another study discovered that performing a sub-lobectomy on glioblastoma patients could enhance their prognosis (median survival from 18.7 to 44.1 months) in comparison to T2 FLAIR border resection, as long as normal brain function is not affected \[9\]. Nonetheless, there remains a lack of consensus in the academic community regarding the optimal surgical resection strategy for glioblastoma patients (such as T1 enhancing border, T2 FLAIR border, sub-lobectomy). In addition, the significant heterogeneity in tumour location, size, infiltration extent, and anatomical proximity across different patients makes it difficult to standardise imaging border resection as an ""individualised"" surgical approach. This places greater demands on the surgical capabilities and knowledge of clinicians in clinical settings. Furthermore, it also introduces multiple confounding factors that hinder the advancement of interventional clinical research.

Therefore, we have thoroughly reviewed recent studies to investigate the prognosis of glioblastoma patients following extended resection. The majority of studies analyzed the prognostic benefits of extended resection beyond T1 enhancement compared to gross total tumor resection, while a few studies evaluated the difference between sub-lobectomy and gross total tumor resection. Extended resection beyond the T1 enhancement region was discovered to prolong the survival of glioblastoma patients, with the prognostic benefits of sub-lobectomy proving significantly pronounced and not associated with further neurological impairment \[9\]. Previous studies have several limitations. Firstly, they are predominantly retrospective, leading to issues with selection bias and retrospective memory bias, among other factors. Furthermore, many of these studies lack a balanced control group. Secondly, factors such as a small number of patient cases, short follow-up time, and poor quality control of follow-up have also contributed to their low level of evidence \[10\]. Furthermore, the classification for glioblastoma were updated in 2021. Patients with gliomas who were included in these studies also await further evaluation to clarify their diagnosis.

Previous studies on the correlation between surgical resection and prognosis of glioblastoma were retrospective due to the absence of molecular pathology. Intraoperative frozen pathology cannot provide real-time diagnosis of glioblastoma. Therefore, molecular testing is crucial for accurate staging and diagnosis. According to the 5th edition of World Health Organization Central Nervous System tumors classification, patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (IDH wild-type) had IDH wild-type adult diffuse glioma accompanied by tissue necrosis, vascular hyperplasia, TERT promoter mutation, +7/-10, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification \[17\]. TERT promoter mutation, which is the most frequent hotspot mutation observed in glioblastomas, is present in almost 80% of patients with glioblastoma mutations \[18\]. We have conducted a range of innovative studies regarding intraoperative rapid integrated diagnosis of gliomas. Our works include ①simplified integrated diagnostic system for human gliomas that is based on a combination of IDH, TERT, and histopathology. ②We have also developed an accurate method for detecting IDH and TERT mutations through the use of locked nucleic acid-amplification refractory mutation system fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ③We have optimized the DNA extraction process and reduced the detection cycle as well. ④Conducting multi-center, prospective clinical trials to verify the feasibility of intraoperative rapid molecular testing. In summary, through combining intraoperative frozen pathology, our technique allows for precise diagnosis of glioblastoma (IDH wild-type) with TERT promoter mutations within 35 minutes intraoperatively, with a sensitivity and specificity of 100.0% when compared with postoperative sequencing data. Furthermore, our prior retrospective study found that a higher degree of surgical resection greatly improved the prognosis of glioblastoma with IDH wild-type/TERTp-mutated, and that sub-lobectomy conferred a more significant prognostic benefit.

Therefore, building on previous work and knowledge in our field, we will conduct a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of sub-lobectomy in the treatment of IDH wild-type/TERTp-mutant glioblastoma. Our study aims to enhance the level of evidence, while also establishing a standardized surgical strategy for glioblastoma.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06368934,imaging; surgery,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

Recurrent glioma patients have very limited treatment options. A major cause of gliomarelated morbidity and mortality is the extensive infiltrative and invasive nature of glioma cells. Thus, inhibition of glioma invasion is a potentially promising strategy.

Work in the Neuro-Oncology Branch laboratory of Dr. Howard Fine has identified TrkA as an important signaling receptor for mediating glioma cell invasion. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Trk potently inhibits glioma invasion and tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. AZD7451 is a first in-class inhibitor of Trk.

OBJECTIVES:

To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous twice a day AZD7451 dosing in patients with recurrent glioblastoma not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED).

To generate pharmacokinetic data on continuous twice a day AZD7451 dosing.

ELIGIBILITY:

Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma are eligible for this study. Patients should have failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy.

DESIGN:

This study will accrue up to 60 evaluable patients. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will receive continuous AZD7451 twice a day orally for 28 days. The MTD will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment only. Up to three patients may be enrolled simultaneously at each dose level. The dose of AZD7451 can be progressively escalated if only 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity at the prior dose level.

At the end of Cycle 1, patients may choose to continue to receive AZD7451 until disease progression or until they experience unmanageable drug related toxicity, as long as they are continuing to derive clinical benefit and do not fulfill any of the criteria for removal from protocol therapy. Each cycle during this extension period will last 28 days.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01468324,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Current treatment policies tend to be no more than palliative. There is no consensus as to how radical the surgery should be. Involved-field radiotherapy is the treatment most likely to be accepted apart from supportive and palliative measures. The role of chemotherapy is barely defined. Study data available to date does not suggest that this patient population would benefit from combined radiochemotherapy. The aim of the study is to verify the hypothesis that first-line chemotherapy with one week on/one week off temozolomide is not inferior to extended-field radiotherapy in the first-line treatment of anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma in the elderly (\> 65 age group). The primary endpoint is median survival, as life expectancy is limited to several months. Secondary endpoints are response rates in both arms (CR, PR, MacDonald et al. 1990), median progression-free survival, 1-year and 2-year survival rates, definition of MGMT as molecular genetic prognostic or predictive markers, and quality of life. Theoretically, it should be possible to preserve quality of life in the first-line chemotherapy arm of the study.","This study is a prospective, randomized Phase III intervention study. Following histological documentation of the diagnosis by biopsy or resection of an anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma, patients will be randomized either to receive postoperative extended-field radiotherapy (arm A) or to receive postoperative chemotherapy with temozolomide (arm B). Randomization will be done for all sites at the CRO, Alcedis GmbH.

For patients intending to participate in the study, the procedure is as follows:

* Request a reference neuropathological review from the brain tumor reference center in Bonn (Prof. Dr. G. Reifenberger) through the local neuropathology department. This review need not be present at randomization because anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma cases are eligible
* Contact: Prof. Dr. W. Wick, Dep.

* Provide written confirmation that the patient signed the ethics committee-approved consent form
* Submit the registration form and a copy of the EORTC-QLQ given in Annexes

In subjects with progressive or recurrent disease, the investigating site will verify whether specific tumor treatment is justified. If yes, chemotherapy with temozolomide is recommended in arm A, possibly after further surgery. Subjects in arm B will receive radiotherapy, possible after further surgery. As all-cause mortality is the primary endpoint, all therapeutic measures following first-line therapy should be documented.

If study treatment is discontinued (first-line therapy) because of progressive disease or if progression occurs after completion of study treatment, the pertinent images should be submitted to the reference center for neuroradiology in Tübingen for reference review.

The treatment modalities employed in the study are chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic procedures licensed in the Federal Republic of Germany for use in human subjects. Temozolomide is currently licensed for treating subjects with recurrent disease and since 2006 in newly diagnosed glioblastoma together with radiotherapy. The time allotted for the individual treatment sections is 6 weeks for radiotherapy, while chemotherapy will be continued until progression or unacceptable adverse effects occur.

It allows maintaining and retrieving future plans, goals, and activities (i.e., remember to remember). PM is associated with most everyday memory problems . PM is crucial to correctly respond to all the social, occupational and working demands of everyday life, to perform many deferred health-related actions and is involved in therapeutic adherence .

Indeed, PM errors are an important part of the aging memory complaints. The prevalence of self-reported PM failures is also significant among young adults, compared with self-reported retrospective memory (RM) failures .Yet, PM errors are major sources of frustration and embarrassment .

In oncology, recently investigated the self-reported memory complaints in a 80 case-healthy-control study breast patients . Subjective memory complaints were assessed using the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire . Results from the Paquet et al. study show that all participants (i.e., both patients and matched-controls) reported more PM than RM failures in daily-life (p\<.001). Breast cancer patients reported more RM and PM failures than controls. However, this group effect was no longer statistically significant when controlling for depression and fatigue.

These findings are consistent with the view that memory complaints are closely associated with depression and cancer-related fatigue, and more generally with psychopathological variables .As underlined by Paquet et al. subjective memory complaints should be investigated because they refer to some aspects of the cancer experience that could potentially be linked to quality of life. Thus, it is important to explore psychopathological basis such as depression, anxiety and fatigue while investigating self-reported memory failures in cancer patients.

Despites the importance of PM, there have been, to our knowledge, only few studies evaluating PM complaints or PM functioning in patients diagnosed with an intracerebral tumor (such as Diffuse Low-Grade Glioma- DLGG- or glioblastome- GB) or extra-cerebral tumor (such as breast cancer - BC). Therefore, the investigators thought it would be useful, as a first step, to conduct a study to explore and to manage the PM and RM subjective complaints in cancer patients compared to another chronic disease, such as HIV. In fine, these data will help to identify a new target for psychological management focused on either psychopathological or neuropsychological rehabilitation","Primary objective :

This study will aim at determining the nature of subjective memory complaints (i.e., prospective or retrospective memory) in cancer patients with intra- cerebral tumors (Glioblastomas and Diffuse Low Grade Gliomas) and extra cerebral tumors (Breast cancer) compared with controls.

The protocol administration will take about 20 minutes. It will be conducted by an experienced clinical neuropsychologist or clinical oncologist in each center during standard care.

Pre-clinical studies of INCB7839 in patient-derived pediatric high-grade gliomas (GBM and DIPG) revealed that INCB7839 inhibits pediatric high- grade glioma growth and improves overall survival. In vivo testing also demonstrated that INCB7839 penetrates brain tissue sufficient to achieve its pharmacodynamic effect of ADAM10 inhibition.

The role of the gastrin is to stimulate the secretion of gastric acids during digestion. It is also important for the regulation of cell growth of the gastric mucosal.

In a healthy person, progastrin is not detectable in the peripheral blood. However, progastrin is abnormally released in the blood of patients with different cancers (colorectal, gastric, ovarian, breast, cervix uterus, melanoma...) The gene GAST coding for progastrin is a direct target gene of the WNT/ß-catenin oncogenic pathway. The activation of this oncogenic pathway is an early event in cancer development.

Chronic activation of the WNT/ß-catenin oncogenic pathway occurs in almost all human solid tumors and is a central mechanism in cancer biology that induces cellular proliferation, blocking of differentiation leading to primary tumor growth and metastasis formation.

Progastrin measured in the peripheral blood of patients on treatments, could be a new powerful marker for diagnosis and prognosis at different stages.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03787056,,Adult,Metastatic,Unclear

NCT06815432,GPC-3 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells for Recurrent GPC-3 Positive Glioblastoma,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,27,ESTIMATED,,4/3/2025,4/3/2044,4/5/2029,Baylor College of Medicine,"Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center",Glioblastoma Multiforme of Brain,15.GPC3-CAR T cells,21 years,65 years,ALL,"The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells.

Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T-cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat participants with cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most participants.

The study team has found from previous research that we can put a new gene (a tiny part of what makes-up DNA and carries the participants traits) into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In the lab, the study team has made several genes called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called GC33. The antibody GC33 recognizes a protein found on the participants brain tumor. This CAR is called GPC3-CAR. To make this CAR more effective, the study has also added a gene that includes IL15. IL15 is a protein that helps CAR T cells grow better and stay in the blood longer so that they may kill tumors better. The mixture of GPC3-CAR and IL15 killed tumor cells better in the laboratory when compared with CAR T cells that did not have IL15. This study will test T cells with the IL15 GPC3-CAR (GO-CART T cells) in participants with GPC3-positive brain tumors.

T cells made to carry a gene called iCasp9 can be killed when they encounter a specific drug called AP1903. The study team will insert the iCasp9 and IL15 together into the T cells using a virus that has been made for this study. The drug (AP1903) is an experimental drug that has been tested in humans with no bad side-effects. The study team will use this drug to kill the T cells if necessary due to side effects.

This study will test T cells genetically engineered with a GPC3-CAR and IL15 (GO-CART T cells) in participants with GPC3-positive brain tumors.

The GO-CART T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.","The study team will collect up to 180 mL (approximately 12 tablespoons) of participants blood. This will be used to grow T cells. The study team grows the T cells and uses a retrovirus (a special virus that can insert the GPC3 CAR and IL15 genes into the T cells) to genetically engineer them. After the CAR and IL15 genes were put into the T cells, the study team ensures that they could kill GPC3 positive solid tumor cells in the laboratory.

WHAT THE TREATMENT WILL BE LIKE:

After making these cells, they were frozen. If the participant agrees to participate in this study, at the time they are scheduled to be treated, the cells will then be thawed and administered in the participants tumor area, called an intracavitary administration, during the participants already scheduled surgical resection. The participant will only get one dose of GO-CART T cells. The participant may be pretreated with Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Tylenol and Benadryl are given to prevent a possible allergic reaction to the T cell administration.

In addition to the GO-CART T cell treatment, during surgery the surgeon will place a small device called an Ommaya reservoir. This device consists of a small tube approximately 3 millimeters in diameter whose tip will sit in the normal fluid filled spaces in the participants brain (called the ventricles). The other end of the tube will be attached to a small reservoir that will sit underneath the participants scalp. Ommaya reservoirs are commonly placed in cancer participants to treat participants with cancer cells in the cerebrospinal fluid and pose a low risk of complications. The purpose of this reservoir is to help reduce the pressure in the participants brain should they experience this from the treatment which is an unlikely but reported side effect . The reservoir will also be used to monitor the participants response to the study treatment rather than to administer treatment.

This is a dose escalation study, which means that the study team does not know the highest dose of GO-CART T cells that is safe. To find out, the cells will be given to at least 3 participants at a lower dose. If that is safe, the study team will raise the dose level that is given to the next group of participants. The dose a participant received will get will depend on how many participants get the agent before the participant and how they react. The investigator will tell the participant this information. Since the treatment is experimental, what is likely to happen at any dose is not known.

All the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center.

Medical tests before treatment:

Before being treated, the participant will receive a series of standard medical tests:

* Physical exam and history
* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.
* Pregnancy test (if the participant is a female who can get pregnant)
* If the participant is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) the study team will do a test to measure the levels of the virus
* Measurements of the participants tumor by scans (either CT or MRI). Side effects are rare and include risk of developing an unrelated cancer due to radiation exposure from the machine, but this is unlikely.

Medical tests during and after treatment:

The participant will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and after:

* Physical exams and History
* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.
* If the participant is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) the study team will repeat the test and monitor the levels of the virus
* Cerebral spinal fluid collections to monitor for any side effects during the course of the treatment
* Measurements of the participants tumor by scans (1 week, and 4 - 6 weeks after the treatment)

FOLLOW-UP STUDIES:

The study team will follow the participant during and after the injections. To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the participants body, up to 60 mL (up to 12 teaspoons, no more than 3mL/kg/day) of blood will be taken before the chemotherapy, before the T-cell infusion, 1 to 4 hours after the infusion, 3 to 4 days after the infusion (this time point is optional) at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the injection, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years and then every year for the next 10 years. Total participation time for this study will be 15 years.

During the time points listed above, if the T cells are found in the participants blood at a certain amount an extra 5mL of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.

The study team will use this blood to look for the frequency and activity of the cells that have been given ; that is, to learn more about the way the T cells are working and how long they last in the body. The study team will also use this blood to see if there are any long-term side effects of putting the new gene (chimeric antigen receptor, CAR) into the cells. In addition to the blood draws, because the participant has received cells that have had a new gene put in them, they will need to have long term follow up for 15 years to see if there are any long-term side effects of the gene transfer.

Once a year, the participant will be asked to have their blood drawn and answer questions about their general health and medical condition. The study team may ask the participant to report any recent hospitalizations, new medications, or the development of conditions or illness that were not present during enrollment in the study and may request that physical exams and/or laboratory tests be performed if necessary.

If the participants tumor requires further surgery after the study treatment, for clinical reasons the study team will request permission to obtain excess sample to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the participants disease.

In the event of death, the study team will request permission to perform an autopsy to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the participants disease and if there were any side effects from the cells with the new gene.

In addition, the study team will ask for the participants permission to use tumor biopsy for research purposes only. Associated risk with the biopsy will be discussed with the participant in detail in a procedure specific consent form. The study team will test the sample to see if the GO-CART T cells can be found in the tumor and what effect they had on the tumor cells.

If the participant develops a second abnormal cancer growth, significant blood or nervous system disorder during the trial, the study team will request that a biopsy sample of the tissue will be tested.

The remaining blood and/or tissue samples that are not needed directly for the participant could be used to help researchers learn about this disease and/or immune therapy. These specimens and information about the participants circumstances may be shared with other cancer researchers. Although there will be a record identifying under what circumstances these specimens were obtained, under all circumstances the participants identity will be kept confidential. There is a small risk for the loss of confidentiality. However, study personnel will make every effort to minimize this risk. Samples will be kept at Baylor College of Medicine until they are exhausted.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06815432,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Current treatments do not provide good control of the disease. In view of the therapeutic impasse, it is necessary to develop new strategies. CAR-T cells (Chimeric antigen receptor T cells) represent a highly promising therapy for the treatment of incurable cancers, including glioblastoma. This treatment aims to destroy cancer cells by relying on the patient's own immune system. CAR-T cells are generated from the patient's own immune cells, more specifically T lymphocytes, which are genetically modified to express a tumor-specific receptor on their surface. CAR-T cells bind to tumor cells and cause their destruction. However, these cells have shown limited therapeutic power in the treatment of brain tumors. This is mainly due to the microenvironment surrounding the tumor, which is composed of immunosuppressive cells. These cells, and the molecules they secrete, help to reduce the activity of CAR-T cells that would otherwise reach the tumor. Little is currently known about these resistance mechanisms. The aim of this research is therefore to better understand these resistance mechanisms in order to propose a strategy for enhancing the therapeutic action of CAR-T cells in the treatment of glioblastoma.

The main objective of this research is to evaluate the impact of the tumor environment on the antitumor efficacy of anti-GD2 CAR-T therapeutic cells in an in vitro glioblastoma model. Both tumor environment cells and CAR-T therapeutic cells will be generated from glioblastoma patient cells.

* Investigate the radiographic response, progression free survival, overall survival
* Investigate the safety profile efficacy of BKM120 in this population

Exploratory Objectives

* Utilize advance MRI (perfusion, permeability, diffusion imaging) to determine the effects of BKM120 on tumor vasculature and to correlate with benefit from BKM120 treatment

STATISTICAL DESIGN:

Cohort 1

The primary endpoint for Cohort 1 is modulation of PI3 kinase pathway based on change in immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring for pAKT. Modulation in scoring as measured by reduction of staining intensity score of one degree or more was reported as a positive response to drug. This portion of the trial would be considered a success if 9 or more participants of 15 participants showed a response. There was a 94% chance of this occurring if the true response rate was 75% and only a 10% chance of this occurring if the true response rate was 40%.

Cohort 2

The primary endpoint for Cohort 2 is the proportion of participants progression free at 6 months (PFS6). Historical comparison data suggest that ineffective therapies in recurrent GBM have a PFS6 rate of approximately 9-16% (Wong 1999; Lamborn 2008). This trial was sized to differentiate between a 15% versus a 32% PFS6. With a total sample size of 50 participants, this design yields at least 90% power with a one sided alpha \< 0.1 to detect a true PFS6 rate of at least 32%.

They are usually treated by surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is used for the treatment of brain tumors which causes damage to the tumor cells. However, radiotherapy can also affect the surrounding healthy cells in the brain, causing inflammation and swelling in the region, which is known as radio necrosis (RN). This is considered a late side effect of radiation and is seen in 10-25% of patients treated with radiation for brain tumors. Sometimes, radionecrosis can be detected on routine imaging during follow-up without new symptoms (asymptomaticRN).

At the same time, in some patients, it can give rise to new symptoms like headaches, weakness, seizures,etc (symptomatic RN). The standard treatment of RN includes steroid medicines called dexamethasone, which is helpful in a proportion of patients.

This is a prospective phase 2 study. This study is being conducted to investigate the ability of the drug Chlorophyllin in the treatment of radionecrosis.

Chlorophyllin is a water-soluble compound obtained from the green plant pigment called chlorophyll. It has been shown to have anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. It is also used as an oral formulation and is an over-the-counter drug in various countries, and also as a food colouring agent.

This is the first time chlorophyllin will be used in the setting of brain radionecrosis. Our primary aim of the study is to assess whether CHL will improve the clinical-radiological response rates. This study will be conducted on a population of 118 patients for a duration of 3 months. The total study duration is 2 years.

The study is funded by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC).","Radiotherapy (RT) forms an integral role in the multi modality management of diffuse gliomas. Radiation is indicated in low-grade gliomas with high-risk features or high-grade gliomas following maximal safe resection. Higher doses of RT can lead to symptomatic radio-necrosis (RN) in approximately 5-15% of patients, typically within the first 2-3 years of RT completion. Development of RN can lead to significant morbidity with new-onset or worsening of pre-existing neurodeficit with substantial implications on quality of life, and in extreme situations, can lead to mortality as well. The pathogenesis of RN is multi factorial, with a complex interplay of vascular-mediated damage and injury to glial cells primarily postulated through the activation of several inflammatory markers like tumor necrosis factor, interleukins, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Corticosteroids, preferably dexamethasone, form the first line of management of RN, with variable response rates ranging from 25-60%, impacted by several factors like a dose of RT and response evaluation methods (neurological/ radiographic). The response rate in our practice concurs with the reported literature with combined clinical and radiological responses seen in approximately 50% of patients from institutional experience and audit. It is important to note the long-standing use of corticosteroids comes at the cost of complications like hyperglycemia, myopathy, and increased risk of infections precluding prolonged use. Also, a proportion of patients remain refractory to steroids or turn out to be dependent on steroids, where bevacizumab (anti-angiogenic agent) can be used as second-line therapy in appropriately selected patients. However, the major disadvantages of bevacizumab remain intravenous administration requiring regular hospital visits, treatment costs, and concerns for related toxicities like hypertension, and intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage. Other agents like hyperbaric oxygen therapy, pentoxifylline, and tocopherol have been suggested in refractory radionecrosis, with questionable benefits. Sodium-copper-Chlorophyllin is a phytopharmaceutical drug obtained from the green plant pigment chlorophyll. It is a semi-synthetic mixture of sodium copper salts derived from chlorophyll. Chlorophyllin scavenges RT-induced free radicals and reactive oxygen species. It is used as a food colorant and over-the-counter in the USA, Japan, Australia, and China for many years for a variety of health benefits, including prevention of body odor in geriatric patients, enhanced wound healing, antibacterial action, prevention of cancer in the high-risk population exposed to hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1, treatment of fecal incontinence, etc. Studies have shown that Chlorophyllin has immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects in addition to antioxidant and radioprotective properties. It increases the expression of a transcription factor (protein) Nrf2, improving lymphocyte survival and enabling efficient detoxification after RT exposure.

There are very few treatment options available for children whose brain tumor grows back after receiving radiation treatment. There is a greater risk of complications and side effects when the brain is repeatedly treated with external radiation. The side effects of repeat radiation treatment are dependent on the amount of the brain that is radiated. Radiation given with PRS during surgery is focused to the specific area of the brain where the tumor is located. Therefore, the area of the brain affected by the radiation is smaller. It is hoped that this targeted radiation will lessen the side effects to the normal brain that is not affected by the tumor. It is also hoped that a lower occurrence of side effects will increase the quality of life of children with brain tumors.

The optimal dose of targeted radiation is not known. Therefore, increasing doses will be given to treat different patients, starting with the lowest possible dose. The amount of radiation to be given will depend on whether or not your child received prior radiation therapy and where the tumor is located. The groups of patients will first be divided into 2 groups: Group A, who are those who received radiation as part of their prior treatment, and Group B, who are those who did not receive any radiation treatment. Each group will be then divided again into 2 groups depending on the location of the tumor. In each group, if the lowest dose is well-tolerated with only minimal side effects by 3 patients, then the next higher dose will be given to the next 3 patients.

The purposes of this research are:

* To evaluate the potential side effects of a single high dose of x-rays using the Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS) given to a small area of the brain.
* To determine the maximum dose of targeted radiation that can be safely given to brain tumors with the fewest side effects.
* To see how well this treatment works for children with recurrent brain tumors and newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.","Central nervous system tumors account for approximately 20% of all childhood neoplasms. The treatment modalities used in the primary management of brain tumors are surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in each of these therapeutic approaches. In spite of these advancements local tumor recurrence continues to be an important reason for treatment failure in these children. The local tumor recurrence rate varies according to the primary tumor type, treatment technique and tumor-stage at initial presentation. After conventional treatment, the local tumor recurrence rate ranges from 10% - 40% in tumors like medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma and low-grade gliomas . However in aggressive tumors like glioblastoma multiforme the tumor recurrence rate in spite of the best modern treatments remains at 80-100%.

Radiation therapy has always played a key role in the management of adult and pediatric brain tumors. There has been considerable interest in treating brain tumors using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Gamma knife or Linear accelerator and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). The goal of stereotactic treatment is to deliver a high dose of radiation with high geometric precision to a discrete tumor located in the brain. This is accomplished by the use of rigid immobilization skull frames and CT / MRI information for treatment planning and tumor targeting. Presently there are several therapeutic options available for children with recurrent brain tumors. Reirradiation has been employed in recurrent gliomas, medulloblastomas and ependymomas with stereotactic radiosurgery stereotactic radiation and brachytherapy . Following reirradiation, tumor control rates of 50-70% have been obtained. The radiosurgery doses used in children with radiation recurrent tumors have ranged from 10-24 Gy. The reirradiation has been generally well tolerated with retreatment complications like transient edema, cranial neuropathy or radiation necrosis observed in 10-15% of children. The results with high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow / stem cell transplantation in children with recurrent malignant gliomas, medulloblastoma and ependymoma have been disappointing with significant morbidity and mortality. Intraoperative radiation has also been utilized for the treatment of primary and recurrent brain tumors. In a report from Japan, 17 patients including two children with radiation recurrent malignant brain tumors were treated with intraoperative radiation to doses of 20 - 40 Gy. Intraoperative radiation was delivered using special applicators and electron beams. The radiation was delivered after tumor resection and doses of 23 - 40 Gy were delivered to depths of 0.5-1.5 cm. The median survival for patients with malignant gliomas and other tumors (ependymoma, oligodendroglioma) was 12 months and 51 months respectively. The two children with ependymoma were cured and are currently alive at 134 and 88 months after intraoperative radiation. Three patients developed symptomatic brain necrosis, two of them had relief of symptoms with surgery and one patient died. Three patients also developed postoperative meningitis. In another report from University of Nebraska Medical Center, 49 patients with glioblastoma multiforme were treated with interstitial Cobalt 60 high dose-rate irradiation to a dose of 20 Gy to the tumor with a 1-cm margin. The patients with no prior radiation therapy (Group I) received an additional 40 Gy of external irradiation. Nineteen of these patients (Group II) had been previously irradiated, and they received only interstitial irradiation. The Cobalt 60 probe was guided into the tumor using CT scans and a stereotactic frame. This treatment was well tolerated, one patient had a dural leak and another had a subdural hematoma. There were no cases of meningitis or radiation necrosis. The median survival for Group I and Group II patients were 7 months and 6 months respectively.

The photon radiosurgery system (PRS) is an intraoperative irradiation device that is capable of delivering high radiation doses to brain tumors. This system has recently been approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS)

The Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS) incorporates a miniature, 40 KeV x-ray source capable of delivering a prescribed radiation dose directly to a target volume. The PRS consists in part of an electron beam-activated x-ray source with a sealed vacuum tube that is 10 cm long and 3.2 mm in outer diameter that is designed for insertion into the body. This vacuum tube incorporates an electron beam target on the inside surface of its tip. When an accelerated electron beam is generated and sent down the tube to strike the target, Bremsstrahlung and line x-rays are emitted from the tip of the tube in a nearly isotropic pattern.

Measurements of dose-rate in a water phantom have determined that the x-ray beam emanates essentially, from a point source, with a nominal dose rate of 150 cGy/min at 10 mm, for a beam current of 40 uA and a voltage of 40 kV. The absolute dose is estimated to be + 10%. The dose distribution in water falls off approximately as a function of the third power of the distance from the power source. The generator is light weighed, only 3.45 lbs. The radiation dose is adjusted by accelerating voltage (ranging from 30 to 50kV), beam current (ranging from 5 to 40 uA) and treatment time (0-60 minutes) through the control console that weighs only 40lbs. The lightweight of PRS system readily allows us to carry the device to the laboratory and the operating room.

For use of the PRS as an adjuvant treatment, treatment applicators made from a rigid biocompatible plastic (ULTEM 1000) with known x-ray transmission characteristics are used. The inside is hollowed out to allow introduction of the PRS x-ray probe to the epicenter of the applicator so that the dose at its outer surface is uniform. The end of the applicators is spherical with its diameter ranging from 1.5 cm to 4 cm. Treatment applicators will be sterilized prior to each use. The applicator is inserted into the tumor-resected cavity to deliver the prescribed dose of radiation.

The operation and dose characteristics of the PRS combine advantages of external beam radiosurgery with those of brachytherapy (implantation of radiation seeds). As with brachytherapy, the PRS can be located very precisely within the target volume, and can improve the delivery of conformal therapy by irradiating the target volume precisely, with little or no scatter of radiation. Due to its very rapid dose fall-off, the PRS significantly reduces the radiation dose delivered to healthy tissues as compared with external beam radiation and radiosurgery. Like radiosurgery, however, the PRS has a very high dose rate and can deliver high radiation doses to the target volume. Another distinct advantage of the PRS system is the ability to significantly decrease the radiation dose to the normal structures in the brain adjacent to the tumor. All of the radiation treatment techniques presently available deliver 10-50% of prescribed dose to the normal brain. Intraoperative irradiation using PRS because of its direct application into the tumor or tumor bed limits the dose to the normal tissue. This approach could result in a significant decrease in radiation induced complications in vital structures such as the optic pathway, brain stem and cerebral blood vessels. Another advantage of PRS is that unlike other types of therapy, the PRS does not require the use of a radiation-shielded room. To summarize, the advantages of the interstitial/surface application of radiation using the PRS are:

1. Direct access to the surgical bed of the tumor
2. Accurate delivery of a high single dose of radiation to the tumor
3. Superior protection of adjacent brain, cranial nerves or other critical structures by the use of intraoperative shielding or intraoperative displacement of these organs
4. Superior radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) of low energy X-rays
5. Tumor dose inhomogeneity similar to brachytherapy and Gamma knife radiosurgery, with the center of the tumor receiving a higher dose than the peripheral region that is adjacent to normal structures.

Results of studies carried out with the PRS in brain tumors have demonstrated it to be capable of delivering a lethal dose of radiation, in a single application to intracranial tumors with minimal side effects. It has been used to treat primary and metastatic brain tumors. In a report from Massachusetts General Hospital, 14 adults with primary and metastatic brain tumors \< 3.5 cm in greatest diameter were treated with a single fraction of irradiation using PRS. The treated tumor diameter ranged from 10mm - 35 mm (mean 21mm), and the tumor edge prescribed dose ranged from 10-20 Gy (average 12.5 Gy). The average treatment time was 23 minutes (range, 7-45 minutes). Local control was obtained in 10 of the 13 patients with a follow-up of 1.5 - 36 months (mean 12 months). All patients tolerated the procedure well, and most patients were discharged home the day after treatment. No new neurological deficits were noted after irradiation. This study aims at determining the maximum tolerated dose of irradiation using PRS in recurrent pediatric brain tumors.

Dose Selection

The radiation dose delivered by the PRS and radiosurgery are similar with regard to dose-rate and total dose. The RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) has performed a dose escalation study to assess the maximum tolerated dose of radiosurgery in adults with previously irradiated brain tumors and brain metastases. Based on acute and late toxicity, the maximum tolerated radiosurgery doses were 24 Gy, 18 Gy and 15 Gy for tumors \< 20 mm, 21-30 mm and 31-40 mm respectively.

In this study we had intended to perform a similar dose escalation study with doses ranging from 10-19 Gy, 10-16 Gy and 10 - 14 Gy for tumors \< 20 mm, 21-25 mm and 26-40 mm respectively. These doses are lower than the established maximum tolerated doses for brain reirradiation in adults with radiosurgery. These doses are also lower than the 20-40 Gy doses utilized for intraoperative irradiation of adult brain tumors with electrons and Cobalt 60 sources.

An interim analysis of patients entered on the study was performed. Based on the occurrence of treatment -related complications in ONE patient who required 2 applicators and in another patient in whom the dose was prescribed to 5 mm depth, the protocol has been modified as follows:

1. No patient will have PRS treatment using more than one applicator
2. The depth of prescribed dose should not exceed 2 mm
3. Patients who have received prior RT and those who have not received prior RT would be classified into Group A and Group B respectively.
4. The dose levels will for these two groups would be as shown in the table in Section 8.0. The dose escalation for non-brainstem (10-19 Gy) remains the same, but dose escalation will no longer be stratified by tumor size. The dose levels for sites adjacent to the brainstem and/or cranial nerves (10-14 Gy) also remain the same. A minimum of 3 patients will have to be accrued in each dose level and only if there are no complications observed, accrual at the next dose level would begin.

Dose escalation will be based on the incidence of acute CNS toxicity defined by RTOG criteria. Unacceptable toxicity will be considered to be irreversible grade 3 (severe), any grade 4 (life threatening) or grade 5 (fatal) RTOG CNS toxicity occurring within 3 months of reirradiation. If no patient developed an unacceptable CNS toxicity as defined below, the dose for that tumor size was then escalated.

The brain stem is very important part of the brain that controls most bodily functions like blood pressure, respiration etc. In this study, we have adopted a gentler dose escalation scheme for tumors in and around the brain stem. The three doses to be studied for tumors in this location are10 Gy, 12 Gy and 14 Gy. These doses will be delivered independent of tumor size.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00179907,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; pediatric,Mixed,Metastatic,Post-Surgery

The treatment strategies for this disease have not changed appreciably for many years consisting of a surgical intervention (biopsy or tumour resection) and post-operative local radiotherapy until several years ago. Combined chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide is at the moment the standard medical practice after results of the joint EORTC-NCIC phase III study randomizing between radiotherapy alone and combined chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide showed a significant improvement in 2-years survival from 8% to 24% for the combined treatment arm (Stupp 2005). Given the poor prognosis of these patients and the still poor treatment response, further therapeutic improvement will remain the most challenging topic for the future. The next step to further improve survival for this patient group would be the addition of biological modifying and/or antiangiogenic therapies. These strategies are motivated by the fact that glioblastomas often express very high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor which is a key mediator of blood vessel growth as high expression of EGFR, which upregulates the downstream PI3K-AKTpathway. (Fischer I, Carmeliet P, Koul D) One possible candidate is nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor interfering with Akt activity downstream of EGFR and upstream of VEGF.

To study how nivolumab affects the brain s immune system in people who have had glioblastoma brain tumors return. To study how nivolumab and BMS-986016 affect brain tumors.

Eligibility:

Adults age 18 and older who have had a return of GBM

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history

Physical exam

Cheek swab

Heart, blood and urine tests

Chest x-ray

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of a cylinder in a strong magnetic field. A contrast agent will be injected in an arm vein.

Participants will stay in the hospital. They will:

Have surgery. A tube will be inserted into the back. Brain tumor and bone marrow samples will be taken. Tubes will be inserted into the brain.

Have a computed tomography brain scan.

Stay in Intensive Care (ICU) 7 days. Fluid from the brain and back will be collected every few hours. In the ICU, participants will get nivolumab by IV for 30 minutes.

After leaving the hospital, participants will have visits every 2 weeks to get the study drugs by IV and have physical exams and blood tests.

Participants will have a brain MRI once a month.

...","Objective

This protocol is being performed to 1) characterize the clinical and 2) immunological response of patients with recurrent glioblastoma to treatment with Nivolumab, together with an anti-Lag-3 antibody, BMS-986016, and to evaluate the safety of brain tumor microdialysis in this patient population.

Study Population

10 patients (total, after replacement for any dropout), 18 years old and older with recurrence of glioblastoma after standard treatment of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.

Study Design

Patients will be screened by study neurosurgeons or neuro-oncologists to verify their confirmed or likely diagnosis of a recurrent glioblastoma. Patients will be offered standard of care therapy, including repeat surgery and/or recommendations for chemotherapeutic agents and other trials. If the patients are deemed to be surgical candidates for their potential recurrence, they will be enrolled in the trial. Enrolled patients will then undergo a stereotactic brain biopsy. If a frozen section confirms a diagnosis of recurrent glioblastoma, two microdialysis catheters will be placed in the brain after the biopsy, and a lumbar drain will also be placed. These microdialysis catheters will sample interstitial fluid in and around the brain tumor every 6 hours. We will collect blood and cerebral spinal fluid samples daily for comparison. After two days (Day 3), the patients will be given one dose of Nivolumab, 240mg IV. We will continue to collect samples every six hours from the microdialysis catheters and daily from blood and cerebral spinal fluid for 5 additional days, after which patients will undergo surgical resection of their tumors and removal of the microdialysis catheters and lumbar drain. Nivolumab, at a dose of 240mg IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks, will be administered after surgery (starting on Day 17(+/- 2 days), two weeks after the first dose on Day 3) followed by BMS 986016, an anti-Lag-3 antibody at a dose of 80mg IV over 60 minutes, until the study neuroradiologist notes tumor progression on MRI or the patient experiences treatment toxicity. While on therapy with Nivolumab and BMS-986016, patients will be seen and examined every 2 weeks +/- two days for signs of toxicity. Patients will be followed for at least three months after the surgical procedure.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measures are the proportion of patients who have a measurable increase of interferon gamma levels in the brain tumor tissue after their first dose of Nivolumab as compared to the pre-treatment baseline, the safety of using brain tumor microdialysis to monitor response to immune modulators in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and the safety of the combination of Nivolumab and BMS-986016. Exploratory outcome measures include: 1) To determine the change in interferon gamma production within the tumor microenvironment and in the rest of the body from before and after therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab; 2) To evaluate the pathological response of the immune microenvironment of brain tumor tissue to the first dose of Nivolumab; 3) To evaluate the clinical response (progression free survival, overall survival) of recurrent glioblastoma patients to this treatment combination; 4) To describe the difference in survival between responders and non-responders on this treatment combination; 5) To examine the differences in the immune cells and secreted factors of the tumor environment as compared to the immune cells and secreted factors of the cerebral spinal fluid, blood and, potentially, bone marrow in response to this treatment.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03493932,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

Most of the immunotherapies that have made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of other tumors in recent years are unsatisfactory in the application of glioblastoma, which is mainly inseparable from the highly inhibitory immune microenvironment formed by the latter. Therefore, how to change this ""immune desert"" and better activate immune effector cells to play an anti-tumor effect is currently a hot spot in glioma immune research. In recent years, there has been continuous research support that the myeloid cells of the central nervous system are partly derived from the bone marrow of the skull, and there is a special channel connection between the skull and the dura mater, through which immune cells can be transported. This suggests that some of the tumor-associated macrophages recruited in the glioblastoma microenvironment may be passed through the dura mater. In previous animal experiments, we blocked the main blood supply to the dura mater by ligating the bilateral external carotid arteries of mice, cutting off the potential supply of dura mater to suppressor myeloid cells in the lesion. The results showed that after ligation of bilateral external carotid arteries, the survival period of tumor-forming mice was significantly prolonged and the prognosis was improved. The proportion of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment of mice decreased significantly, and the expression of tumor suppressor molecules such as arginase Arg1 decreased, indicating that the improvement of mouse prognosis was closely related to the proportion and phenotypic changes of myeloid cells after dural blood supply blockade. The meningeal lymphatic system of the human central nervous system has been shown to be an important part of the immune system, while the external carotid artery system, the main source of blood supply to the dura, carries abundant immune cells that ooze out to the dura mater through the endothelial window hole of the dural blood vessel, which is an important source of dural immune cells. In the glioblastoma immune microenvironment, the source of immune cells includes dural branches from the external carotid artery system in addition to branches of the internal carotid artery system. Therefore, for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, this study involves embolization of the dural branch of the external carotid artery system (bilateral middle meningeal artery) to block the dural blood supply before craniotomy. At the same time, microsurgery under multimodal image navigation was used to remove the tumor. It is expected to be effective in reducing the proportion of myeloid suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment, slowing the growth rate of residual tumor cells, and prolonging the tumor-free progression and survival of patients.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05990556,,Adult,Unclear,Surgery
NCT00916409,"A Prospective, Multi-center Trial of NovoTTF-100A Together With Temozolomide Compared to Temozolomide Alone in Patients With Newly Diagnosed GBM.",COMPLETED,['PHASE3'],INTERVENTIONAL,700,ESTIMATED,,2009-06,2017-03,2016-12,NovoCure Ltd.,,Glioblastoma Multiforme,NovoTTF-100A device; Temozolomide,18 years,,ALL,"The study is a prospective, randomly controlled pivotal trial, designed to test the efficacy and safety of a medical device, the NovoTTF-100A, as an adjuvant to the best standard of care in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients. The device is an experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic administration of alternating electric fields (termed TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by means of surface, insulated electrode arrays.","PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:

The effect of the electric fields generated by the NovoTTF-100A device (TTFields, TTF) has been tested in a large prospective, randomized trial, in recurrent GBM. The outcome of subjects treated with the NovoTTF-100A device was compared to those treated with an effective best standard of care chemotherapy (including bevacizumab). NovoTTF-100A subjects had comparable overall survival to subjects receiving the best available chemotherapy in the US today. Similar results showing comparability of NovoTTF-100A to BSC chemotherapy were seen in all secondary endpoints.

Recurrent GBM patients treated with the NovoTTF-100A device in this trial experienced fewer side effects in general, significantly fewer treatment related side effects, and significantly lower gastrointestinal, hematological and infectious adverse events compared to controls. The only device-related adverse events seen were a mild to moderate skin irritation beneath the device electrodes. Finally, quality of life measures were better in NovoTTF-100A subjects as a group when compared to subjects receiving effective best standard of care chemotherapy.

In a small scale pilot trial in newly diagnosed GBM patients, the treatment was well tolerated and suggested that NovoTTF-100A may improve time to disease progression and overall survival of newly diagnosed GBM patients. Although the number of patients in the pilot trial was small, The FDA has determined that the data gathered so far warrant testing of NovoTTF-100A treatment as a possible therapy for patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:

All patients included in this trial are newly diagnosed GBM patients who underwent a biopsy or surgery (with or without Gliadel wafers), followed by radiation therapy in combination with Temozolomide chemotherapy. In addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria.

Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

1. Treatment with the NovoTTF-100A device in combination with Temozolomide chemotherapy.
2. Treatment with Temozolomide alone, as the best known standard of care.

Patients will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio (2 of every three patients who participate in the trial will be treated with the NovoTTF-100A device). Baseline tests will be performed in patients enrolled in both arms, including specific genetic tests done using tumor samples obtained during their initial surgery. If assigned to the NovoTTF-100A in combination with Temozolomide group, the patients will be treated continuously with the device until second progression. They will also receive temozolomide and possibly a second line treatment that can be one of the following: re-operation, local radiotherapy (gamma-knife), a second line of chemotherapy or a combination of the above.

NovoTTF-100A treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrode arrays on the head. Electrode array placement will require shaving of the scalp before and frequently during the treatment. After an initial short visit to the clinic for training and monitoring, patients will be released to continue treatment at home where they can maintain their regular daily routine.

During the trial, regardless of which treatment group the patient was assigned to, he or she will need to return once every month to the clinic where an examination by a physician and a routine laboratory examinations will be done. These routine visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing for the second time under the study treatment. If such occurs, patients will need to return once per month for two more months to the clinic for similar follow up examinations.

During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically. Additionally, routine blood tests will be performed. A routine MRI of the head will be performed at baseline and every second month thereafter, until second progression. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.

SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:

Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.

Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues. TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200 thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.

The breakthrough finding made by NovoCure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of electric charge.

As a result of these two effects, cancer tumor growth is slowed and can even reverse after continuous exposure to TTFields.

Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach.

In conclusion, TTField hold the promise of serving as a brand new cancer treatment with very few side effects and promising affectivity in slowing or reversing this disease.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00916409,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Effective March 2017, randomization to Group III has been terminated. All consented patients will undergo a leukapheresis after resection for harvest of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBLs) for generation of DCs. Patients will then receive Radiation Therapy (RT) and concurrent TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m\^2/d. Patients should start RT within approximately 6 weeks of surgery. Patients who experience progressive disease during radiation, are dependent on steroid supplements above physiologic levels at time of first vaccination, are unable to tolerate TMZ, or whose DCs or PBLs fail to meet release criteria will be withdrawn from the study and replaced and will not undergo repeat leukapheresis. For patients whose initial leukapheresis yields less than 3 vaccines, repeat leukapheresis may be obtained a minimum of 2 weeks from the previous leukapheresis (and may be repeated as needed) if pre-pheresis blood work is within the Apheresis Center's parameters and as long as this does not cause a significant delay in treatment for the patient.

After RT and concurrent TMZ, patients will then be randomized and begin the initial cycle of TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 150-200mg/m\^2/d for 5 days at the discretion of the treating oncologist 4 (± 2) weeks after completing RT. The study cycle of TMZ comprises a targeted dose of 150-200mg/m\^2/d for 5 days every 5 (± 1) weeks. All patients will receive up to a total of 10 DC vaccines given bilaterally at the groin site unless progression occurs. DC vaccines will be given intradermally (i.d.) and divided equally to both inguinal regions. DC vaccines #1-3 will be given every two weeks, thus delaying the initiation of TMZ cycle 2. Patients will then be vaccinated in conjunction with subsequent TMZ cycles every 5 (± 1) weeks for a total of 6 to 12 cycles after RT at the discretion of the treating oncologist. DCs will be given on day 21 ± 2 days of each TMZ cycle. DC vaccinations will continue during TMZ cycles up to a total of 10 unless progression occurs.

Before the first DC vaccination, all patients will receive immunization with 0.5 mL of Td intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle to ensure adequate immunity to the tetanus antigen. Those assigned to Group III will receive basiliximab 20 mg infusions 1 week before the 1st and 1 week before the 2nd vaccine. At the time of the fourth DC vaccine, patients will receive pre-conditioning per the assigned group (Group I-unpulsed DCs i.d.; Group II- Td i.d.; Group III-Td i.d.). A single dose of Td toxoid (1 flocculation unit, in 0.3 milliliters (mLs) of saline for a total volume of 0.4 mLs) or 0.4 mLs of 1 x 10\^6 autologous unpulsed DCs in saline will be administered to a single side of the groin, and 0.4 mLs of saline administered to the contralateral side 12-24 hours prior to the fourth DC vaccine, which is always given bilaterally at the groin site. Patients in Groups I and II will then receive 111In-labeled DCs to compare the effects of different skin preparations on DC migration followed by Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography and Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging immediately and at 1 and 2 days after injection. Group III will not undergo migration studies. Groups I and II will be double blinded. Group III will not be blinded.

All patients will undergo leukapheresis again for immunologic monitoring with specific assessment of baseline antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses and further DC generations 4 (± 2) weeks after vaccine #3. Patients will be imaged bimonthly without receiving any other prescribed anti-tumor therapy. Patients will undergo an additional leukapheresis for generation of DCs if needed to continue vaccinations.

As part of standard care for these patients, upon tumor progression, participants may undergo stereotactic biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure consent will be obtained separately.

The purpose of a pilot clinical study is to obtain preliminary data to support the reason for doing a larger clinical trial on testing the clinical effectiveness of an investigational intervention. ""Investigational"" means that the role of MET-PET scans is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not approved this intervention for your type cancer.

In this research study, the investigators are evaluating whether or not MET-PET scans have value in predicting response to standard chemoradiation therapy in participants with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma. A standard treatment for glioblastoma is treatment with a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with the drug temozolomide.

In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells. With standard PET scans, the radioactive substance used is FDG. FDG goes to many areas of the normal brain which makes it difficult for use in distinguishing brain tumors from normal tissue.

For the PET scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance called MET, instead of the standard substance FDG. MET gets absorbed by cancer cells but not by normal brain and therefore may be better than FDG in evaluating brain tumors and therefore may be better than FDG in evaluating brain tumors and their response to treatment.

In this research study, participants will receive standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy for glioblastoma as well as standard MRI scans. In addition, participants will undergo L-\[Methyl\]-11C Methionine Positron Emission Tomography (MET-PET) scans twice. The first MET-PET scan will occur after enrollment but prior to radiation therapy. The second MET-PET scan will occur approximately one month after completion of radiation therapy.","After agreeing to take part in this research study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedure recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. The screening process will include the following: A medical history, performance status, physical exam, routine blood tests, assessment of your tumor, diagnosis confirmation and pregnancy test. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.

Within 3 weeks after your surgery you will undergo a MET-PET scan to define residual metabolic activity.

After completion of radiation therapy at 1,3,5,7,9 and 11 months following radiation therapy you will undergo: a medical history, physical exam, assessment of your tumor by MRI, documentation of your current dose of steroids, blood tests and an evaluation for side effects.

At one month after the completion of radiation therapy you will undergo the second and final MET-PET scan to assess response to therapy.

After the study patients will follow their standard treatment pathway.","Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumour in adults. Its outcomes are poor due to local disease progression in most patients. Current treatment includes surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy 4-6 weeks after surgery. In this time interval, some tumour cells do not receive any treatment. Furthermore, studies show that around half of all glioblastoma patients experience rapid early progression (REP) i.e. growth of the tumour in the time interval between surgery and postoperative chemotherapy/radiotherapy. REP is associated with a shorter survival and there are currently no effective treatments or preventative measures to address it.

Tumour Treating Fields (TTFields), also known as Optune, is a locally applied treatment modality that has contributed to a better survival outcome for glioblastoma patients when used after surgery and chemo-radiotherapy. We hypothesize that earlier treatment using the Optune device before the surgery and between the surgery and postoperative radiotherapy can prevent REP and improve patient outcome. In this phase 1 trial, PORTRAIT (PreOpeRaTive pRerAdIotherapy Ttfields), we will test the safety and feasibility of Optune treatment before surgery and before post-operative radiotherapy in a maximum of 14 patients. Participants will be required to undergo additional MRI sequencing scans and provide blood, tear fluid and tissue samples over a maximum of 6 months.

NCT02287428,A Phase I Study of a Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine With Radiotherapy Plus Pembrolizumab/MK-3475 Among Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients,RECRUITING,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,56,ESTIMATED,"David A.

This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the intervention to use for further studies. ""Investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with glioblastoma.

The purpose of the initial study cohort (Cohort 1) is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against glioblastoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of the participants tumor. It is known that glioblastomas have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient's tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause the glioblastoma to come back in the future.

Three additional cohorts (1a, 1b, \& 1c) were added to the study following completion of accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1). Each new cohort receives NeoVax and radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab: cohort 1a patients will start pembrolizumab w/in 2 weeks after start of RT, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1b patients will start pembrolizumab 2-4 weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1c patients will receive a single dose of pembrolizumab administered within 2 weeks after start of RT, re-start 2-4 weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. The rationale for adding these new cohorts is: 1) to assess the safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab; and 2) to determine if the timing of anti-PD-1 administration impacts the immunogenicity of NeoVax.

An additional sub-study cohort (1d) is being added for patients whose tumor is MGMT-methylated. Cohort 1d will enroll patients with tumors for which the MGMT status is methylated or partially methylated; patients on cohort 1d will receive standard daily temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy for up to six cycles following completion of radiation therapy. The rationale for adding cohort 1d is to determine the safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab and temozolomide.","It is known that glioblastomas have mutations that are specific to an individual patient's tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause glioblastoma to recur.

Methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein which can be increased in some cancers, including glioblastoma. MGMT works to repair the DNA of cancer cells that are damaged by treatment. If a tumor is found to be ""unmethylated"", it means there is more MGMT present in the tumor than one that is ""methylated"".

Methylation of MGMT is believed to make tumor cells more responsive to drugs like temozolomide. Studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.

Patients with glioblastoma usually receive six weeks of radiation with a daily chemotherapy called temozolomide after their surgery, followed by six to twelve months of additional temozolomide. In this study, only participants whose tumors are MGMT-methylated will receive temozolomide; those participants whose tumors are MGMT-unmethylated will not receive temozolomide, as studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.

On this trial, an initial cohort of participants (Cohort 1) will receive the Personalized NeoAntigen Vaccine (5 priming doses and 2 booster doses over \~ 20 weeks) after having completed six weeks of standard radiation. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response.

Three additional cohorts (1a, 1b, \& 1c) were added to the study following completion of accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1). Each new cohort receives NeoVax and radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab: cohort 1a patients will start pembrolizumab w/in 2 weeks after start of RT, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1b patients will start pembrolizumab 2-4 weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1c patients will receive a single dose of pembrolizumab administered within 2 weeks after start of RT, re-start 2-4 weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years.

Despite recent diagnostic and therapeutic advances, including aggressive surgical resection and chemoradiation, the prognosis of GBM has improved only slightly over the past two decades, with median survival of approximately 15 months. Tumor hypoxia is a feature of GBM that contributes to poor outcome through multiple mechanisms such as 1) overexpression of enzymes that play roles in temozolomide resistance, the main chemotherapeutic agent in GBM and 2) increase expression of cancer stem cells which are more resistant to radiation. Hypoxic tumour regions are associated with higher rates of progression and recurrence.

In this study the investigators will use an advanced MRI technique called qBOLD to non-invasively measure oxygenation in GBM and obtain targeted biopsies. The investigators take advantage of physical characteristics of Ferumoxytol (Feraheme®) which is an iron supplement, and utilize two recent technical advances not previously used in human tumours to quantitatively measure oxygenation in GBM.

Prior knowledge of hypoxia can assist in prognostication and individualization of treatment planning with special focus on hypoxic regions by targeted radiation dose or regimen modulation; consideration of more intensive chemotherapy regimens; more aggressive and targeted surgical resection and closer short-term clinical and imaging follow-ups.","We propose a study to demonstrate quantitative oxygen saturation estimation in GBM is feasible with qBOLD and it correlates with established histopathological markers of hypoxia and angiogenesis, and targeted intraoperative oxygen measurement.

All patients will undergo surgery as part of their standard treatment. By coregistering the hypoxia map on presurgical MRI we will be able to do the following:

1. Obtain targeted biopsies of the hypoxic areas and none hypoxic areas and correlate them with gold standard marker of tissue hypoxia by immunohistochemistry for hypoxia induced factor-1α (HIF-1α).
2. Draw Volumes of interests (VOI) over areas \>0.5-cm3 (amenable to accurate intra-operative O2 measurement) with the lowest and highest oxygen saturation (SO2) values.

NCT04482933,Phase II Clinical Trial of HSV G207 With a Single 5 Gy Radiation Dose in Children With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma,RECRUITING,['PHASE2'],INTERVENTIONAL,35,ESTIMATED,"Gregory K Friedman, MD; Gregory Friedman, MD (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center)",7/1/2025,2/15/2030,12/16/2029,Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium,"Treovir, LLC; National Cancer Institute (NCI); American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities",Neoplasms; High Grade Glioma; Glioblastoma Multiforme; Malignant Glioma of Brain; Anaplastic Astrocytoma of Brain; High-grade Glioma; Anaplastic Glioma; Giant Cell Glioblastoma,Biological G207,3 years,21 years,ALL,This study is a clinical trial to assess the efficacy and confirm the safety of intratumoral inoculation of G207 (an experimental virus therapy) combined with a single 5 Gy dose of radiation in recurrent/progressive pediatric high-grade gliomas,"Outcomes for children with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma (brain tumor) are very poor, and there are a lack of effective salvage therapies once a patient fails standard treatments. Novel innovative treatments are greatly needed.

G207 is an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV) that has been successfully engineered to introduce mutations in the virus that enable it to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells, but not normal cells. Replication of G207 in the tumor not only kills the infected tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus engenders an anti-tumor immune response; the virus is immunogenic and produces a debris field which exposes cancer cell antigens to immune cells, which can target other cancer cells. Thus, the oncolytic effect of the virus and the immune response that the virus stimulates provide a dual attack against cancer cells. In preclinical studies, a single 5 Gy dose of radiation within 24 hours of virus inoculation to the tumor increased virus replication and tumor cell killing. Radiation may also enhance the immune response against the tumor.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham has conducted three phase I trials of G207 injected into the recurrent tumor alone or combined with a single dose of radiation in adults with recurrent high-grade gliomas. In these trials, high doses (up to 3 x 10\^9 plaque-forming units) of virus were safely injected directly into the tumor or surrounding brain tissue without serious toxicities. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence of an antitumor response was seen in some patients. Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that a variety of aggressive pediatric brain tumor types are sensitive to G207.

A Phase I study of intratumoral G207 alone or combined with a 5 Gy dose of radiation in children ages 3-18 with biopsy-confirmed recurrent/progressive supratentorial brain tumors recently completed the highest planned dose level (UAB1472; NCT02457845). The study used a 3 + 3 design with 4 dose cohorts.12 Patients underwent stereotactic placement of up to 4 intratumoral catheters. The following day they received a single controlled-rate infusion of G207 (1 x 10\^7 or 1 x 10\^8 pfu) over 6 hours. Cohorts 3 and 4 received a 5 Gy radiation fraction to the gross tumor volume within 24 hours of G207. Twelve subjects with progressive high-grade glioma received G207. Twenty adverse events, all grade 1, were attributed to G207. G207 was determined to be safe and tolerable in children and a recommended Phase 2 was established (1 x10\^8 followed by 5 Gy radiation to the tumor).

This study is a phase II, open-label, single arm clinical trial of G207 alone or combined with a single low dose of radiation in children with recurrent or progressive high grade glioma. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy. The secondary objectives are to confirm the safety and tolerability of G207, to survey for virologic shedding following G207, to evaluate immunologic responses to G207, and to assess for radiographic changes from baseline.

* Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. With optimal treatment,consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, median survival is 14.6 months. Most patients have evidence of tumor progression within one year of diagnosis despite treatment. At progression, treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective.
* Recently, bevacizumab was approved for recurrent GBM patients who fail bevacizumab indicate a short survival, on the order of 10 weeks, an approximate PFS 3 and 6 months of 0%.
* Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR), Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-Kit, and was recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma.
* Topotecan is an orally bioavailable topoisomerase I and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha inhibitor with reasonably high central nervous system (CNS)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration
* Recent pre-clinical reports have begun to argue for the clinical testing of metronomic chemotherapy administration in various cancers. The theory of improved activity of Pazopanib + Topotecan administered metronomically is based on targeting tumor vasculature (both existing capillary endothelial cells and circulating bone marrow derived endothelial cell precursors), immune modulation, as well as tumor cell HIF-1 alpha inhibition, and the induction of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Further support for the combination comes from recent data tying drug-induced VEGF inhibition to the induction of HIF-1 alpha activity in GBM suggesting possible synergy between Pazopanib and Topotecan
* The combination of Topotecan and Pazopanib has been directly demonstrated as active in

animal models

Objectives

* 6 month progression free survival rate for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with pazopanib and topotecan (Group A).
* 3 month progression free survival rate for rGBM patients with prior bevacizumab exposure treated with pazopanib and topotecan (Group B).

Eligibility

* Histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma (GS) with evidence of progression on MRI or CT scan.

* Patients must be greater than 12 weeks following completion of chemoradiation.

  * Archived tumor tissue must be available for confirmation of the diagnosis
  * Patients must be \> 18 years old.
  * Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of \> 60.
  * Patients must have adequate organ function.
  * No pregnancy or lactation.
  * Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigators opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the patients ability to tolerate this therapy.
  * No history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years are eligible.
  * No clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding including, or the absorption of the medications.
  * No prior major surgery or trauma within 28 days and/or presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer (procedures such as catheter placement not considered to be major).
  * No evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis.
  * No known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels.
  * No serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other condition that could interfere with subjects safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to study procedures.
  * No ongoing toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy that is \> Grade 1 and/or that is progressing in severity, except alopecia.
  * No ongoing use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic agents (EIAEDs), unless 2 week washout has elapsed form last dose of EIAED.
  * No known hypersensitivity to pazopanib or topotecan or to their excipients.

Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV astrocytoma, is the most common subtype and unfortunately also the most aggressive subtype with median survival in population based cohorts being only 10 months. Extensive surgical resections followed by postoperative fractioned radiotherapy and concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide prolong survival and is the standard treatment.

The investigators think there is significant potential in individualized surgical decision-making in glioblastoma management. The idea that some patients are amendable to radical surgery, while others should be treated more conservatively, is not controversial in other fields of oncology. The current concept in all patients with glioblastoma is ""maximum safe resection of the contrast enhancing tumor"", but this may in selected cases be extended to simply ""maximum safe resection"" tailored to the patient and extent of disease at hand.

Densely proliferating tumor cells have been found from at an average of 10 mm beyond the margins of contrast enhancement in high-grade gliomas. There are now several case series, using various definitions of supramarginal resection, but they have in common that they report a benefit of resection with a margin. This potential benefit also comes together with an associated neurological risk, making this approach unethical and simply not feasible in the patients with glioblastoma as a whole.

Objective of this study is: To investigate if resection with a margin, that is significantly beyond the radiological contrast enhancement, improves survival in selected patients with glioblastoma.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04243005,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

IMPT is also focused radiation therapy similar to IMRT, but it uses proton particles to deliver the radiation instead of photon beams. IMPT also uses advanced computer planning in order to shape the dose to the target with the least dose to surrounding normal tissues.","Study Groups:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

If you are in Group 1, you will receive IMRT.

If you are in Group 2, you will receive IMPT.

Radiation Therapy:

In both groups, you will receive radiation treatments each day, Monday-Friday, starting on Day 1. You will continue to receive radiation treatment until you have completed 30 total treatments. This is a total of up to 6 weeks of treatment.

You will sign a separate consent form for the IMRT or IMPT that will explain the procedures and risks in detail.

Study Visits:

Before beginning radiation, you will have what is called a ""simulation"" to plan your radiation. During the simulation, you will be flat on your back on a computed tomography (CT) table and a soft plastic mask will be made to help hold your head still during treatment. This is the position you will be in when you receive radiation treatment. You will then have a CT scan, which will make computerized images to help plan your treatment.

At Month 2 (+/- 30 days):

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.
* You will have an MRI to check the status of the disease.
* You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.
* You will complete the thinking skills tests and the questionnaires about your quality of life and symptoms.

Length of Treatment:

You may receive up to 6 weeks of radiation therapy. You will no longer be able to receive radiation therapy if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

Your active participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

Follow-Up:

At Month 4 (+/- 30 days) and then every 2 months for up to 2 years after radiation therapy:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.
* You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a type of malignant glioma. These cancers are nearly always fatal. People who develop these cancers get aggressive treatments. But the tumors almost always recur. Researchers want to study people with newly diagnosed disease to learn more.

Objective:

To study people with newly diagnosed GBM or gliosarcoma to look at the changes in immune cells in the blood of those who take ipilimumab and nivolumab, along with temozolomide.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18 and older with newly diagnosed GBM or gliosarcoma, who have had surgical removal of their tumor and have completed standard initial chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Design:

Participants will be screened with the following:

Medical record review

Medical history

Physical exam

Tests to assess their nervous system and their ability to do typical activities

Blood tests

Tumor assessment. For this, they will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They may get a contrast dye through an intravenous (IV) catheter. The MRI scanner makes noise. They will get earplugs.

Electrocardiogram. It measures heart rate and rhythm. They will lie still. Sticky pads will be placed on their chest, arms, and legs.

Screening tests will be repeated during the study.

Treatment will be given in cycles. Each cycle lasts 4 weeks. Participants will get nivolumab and ipilimumab via IV. They will take temozolomide by mouth. They will keep a pill diary.

Participants will fill out surveys about their symptoms.

Participants will have follow-up visits about 60 days and 100 days after treatment ends. Then they will be contacted every 6 months for the rest of their life.","Background:

Glioblastoma (GBM) represents an aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options. The immunosuppressive nature of GBM may be reversible with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, however, initial studies have yet to demonstrate this. It is postulated that trafficking of peripherally activated lymphocytes may play a role in generating a robust intracranial immune response. Therefore, a blood-based assay to identify peripheral blood response may both predict response and better identify the ideal patient populations for future ICI clinical trials.

Objectives:

Determine if the outcomes, as measured by overall survival, is improved in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma when treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors result in an immune response in peripheral blood T lymphocytes.

Eligibility:

Histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed primary glioblastoma or gliosarcoma;

Age greater than or equal to 18 years;

Adequate organ function;

Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 70;

Subjects must recently complete resection and chemoradiation;

Subjects must not have prior immunotherapy, other current investigational agents, or corticosteroid treatment \> 30mg cortisone-equivalents per day.

Design:

Open-label, investigator-initiated exploratory study of newly-diagnosed GBM who have completed resection and chemoradiation.

Participants will be randomized to be treated in Arm 1 or 2, consistent of adjuvant chemotherapy (temozolomide (TMZ)) and immunotherapy (nivolumab + ipilimumab):

TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 PO on days 1-5 q28 days for cycles 1-6)

Arm 1:

Nivolumab (1 mg/kg IV q2weeks for cycles 1-4, then 480 mg IV q4weeks for cycles 5-16) + ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV q4 weeks for cycles 1-4)

Arm 2:

Nivolumab (1 mg/kg IV q2weeks for cycles 1-4, then 480 mg IV q4weeks for cycles 5-16) + ipilimumab (3 mg/kg IV q4 weeks for cycles 1-4)

For the primary objective, serial examination of peripheral blood, including comprehensive flow cytometric analysis of leukocyte populations and cytokines, and Interferon- \>= (IFN- \>=) ELISPOT functional analysis of CD4+/8+ response to common recall antigens will be used to determine systemic response to ICI treatment.

For the secondary objectives, correlative studies assess peripheral blood T cells' ability to respond to an in vitro stimulation paradigm, including nivolumab and ipilimumab, in a microbead-based model. The T cell response to pretreatment in vitro stimulation would be compared to post-treatment in vivo stimulation to determine if this in vitro model can predict in vivo response.

Additional exploratory studies are planned to characterize the in vivo immune response to adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, including but not limited to:

If the proposed study demonstrates that NPC sparing RT is not associated with increased LR in the spared regions of the brain compared to conventional RT, it will ideally serve as the foundation for a future multi-institutional randomized controlled trial comparing neurocognitive outcomes in patients treated with NPC-sparing RT versus conventional radiation therapy.","Radiation therapy (RT) is an integral component of the management of brain tumors, but cognitive deficits following cranial irradiation are well documented. There is an association between damage to neural progenitor cells (NPC) and neurocognitive dysfunction. NPC are similarly known to play an important role in recovery from damage to the brain, including radiation-induced damage. However NPC are extremely sensitive to radiation. In spite of this information, current RT planning techniques do not limit the radiation dose to the NPC containing regions. Recent human studies have demonstrated that it is possible to use intensity modulated radiation therapy to reduce the radiation dose to NPC containing regions during RT for brain tumors, without compromising coverage of the tumor. We hypothesize that NPC-sparing RT will reduce neurocognitive decline following treatment for brain tumors, without compromising tumor local control. However, there is conflicting data regarding the role of NPC in the development of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Some studies suggest that GBM are derived from NPC whereas others have associated NPC with improved tumor control following therapy for GBM. Prior to evaluation of neurocognitive outcomes with NPC-sparing RT, it is therefore imperative to evaluate whether NPC-sparing RT techniques lead to increased LR in the spared NPC containing niches of the brain.

The proposed study is designed to evaluate LR in the spared regions of the brain following NPC sparing RT in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Our research will consist of 3 specific aims: 1) Determine the LR rate at 1 year in the spared NPC containing niches in patients treated with NPC sparing RT for GBM; 2) Quantify the extent of radiation dose sparing to the NPC containing regions that is possible without compromising tumor coverage in patients with GBM; 3) Determine if it is feasible to evaluate cognitive function prospectively in patients undergoing NPC sparing RT for GBM.

The long term goal of this research is to establish whether NPC sparing RT techniques improve neurocognitive outcomes compared to conventional RT for brain tumors. If the proposed study demonstrates that NPC sparing RT is not associated with increased LR in the spared regions of the brain compared to conventional RT, it will ideally serve as the foundation for a future multi-institutional randomized controlled trial comparing neurocognitive outcomes in patients treated with NPC-sparing RT versus conventional radiation therapy.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01478854,imaging,Adult,Primary,Unclear

The number of primary diagnostic patients and deaths of GBM in China ranks first in the world every year, which seriously threatens people's life and health. At present, the clinical treatment strategy of maximum surgical resection combined with concurrent chemo- and radio-therapy and TTF treatment is still not satisfactory, and the median survival time of GBM patients is only 14.4 months. Statins inhibit cholesterol production with few side effects and are widely used for cholesterol control in patients with hyperlipidemia. In recent years, statins have shown good anti-tumor effect. Our previous study found that statins can block the malignant progression of glioma mediated by EGFR pathway. Therefore, the investigators report a clinical study protocol designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a comprehensive treatment strategy of atorvastatin (ATO) combined with temozolomide (TMZ) in primary and recurrent glioblastomas with high EGFR expression.

The investigators designed a multicenter, single-arm, double-blind, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ATO combined with TMZ in EGFR-high expressing GBM. After informed consent was signed by the patient or authorized family members, the patients were treated with the current STUPP regimen and ATO (20mg, qn) orally. The patients were regularly followed up for 52 weeks after treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), which was defined as the time from the start of GBM surgery to tumor progression (recurrence) or death. The secondary end point was the rate of tumor control, which was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response, a partial response, or a stable disease that had shrunk or remained stable for a given period of time. Safety will be assessed during the study by monitoring of regular MRI scans, laboratory tests (liver function, lipid profile, blood routine), electrocardiography, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature), and weight.

The results of this clinical trial will provide key information on whether the oral combination of atorvastatin and temozolomide prolongs PFS in EGFR-high GBM patients with efficacy and safety.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06327451,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

In all arms, patients will receive the SoC and will be randomized to receive either placebo or LAM561 dose.

The study is planned to enrol 140 patients. The primary endpoints of the study are PFS (for CMA) and OS (for FMA) as assessed after observing at least 66 PFS events and at least 90 OS events, respectively. It is expected that the analysis for PFS will be performed 1-2 years earlier than the analysis for OS.

An IDMC (Independent Data Monitoring Committee) meeting took place to assess the trial's futility and safety data from the start of the trial until September 2023. The IDMC had open access to the data without blinding; after analysis IDMC concluded that there were no concerns that would necessitate stopping the study for ethical reasons or safety issues that could adversely affect patients due to taking the medication, so the study is continuing as normal with no changes.

After 45 events for PFS are observed, a formal interim analysis will be performed and the data reviewed by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) or may be activated by the IDMC 12 months after the inclusion of the last patient if follow up is sufficient to identify an overall PFS or OS significant deviation from the literature. After reviewing the interim results, the iDMC will make recommendations regarding: the sample size and the continuation of the trial overall.

Further, the sample size and events will be re-estimated to ensure that the statistical power is maintained given the estimated treatment effect at interim analysis. The events/sample size increase will be based on the considerations of the success probability.

For that purpose, based on the conditional power, the interim results will be classified into the following zones: favourable, unfavourable or promising.

If the interim results fall in the promising zone, then it is planned to increase the total number of events both for PFS and OS by up to 50%, with up to 99 events for PFS and up to 135 events for OS. The total sample size will also be increased to up to 210 patients to ensure the desired number of events within a realistic time. If the interim results are favourable or unfavourable, the study size will remain as initially planned with 66 events for PFS and 90 for OS, collected from 140 patients.

The IDMC committee experts met in February 2024 after 45 PFS events occurred in the trial. Unblinded medical and clinical statistical data from 103 patients were evaluated to assess the efficacy - progression free survival (tumour growth or clinical deterioration) - of LAM561. The IDMC confirmed that, at the current level of evidence, after evaluating the Conditional Power of the unblinded results, no futility has been identified and recommends continuation of the study without modification.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04250922,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

For the purpose of this study, patients will undergo the standard CT SIM, and MR SIM necessary for radiation therapy, creating the masks from the MRIs. Prior to the start of their treatment, patients will have an additional CT scan with the 3D printed mask to confirm safety and treatment accuracy. Patients will then proceed with their standard radiation therapy, immobilized with the mask.

Moreover, after surgical biopsy or resection, many Centers perform repeated post-operative imaging. Despite all prior imaging, when radiotherapy treatment is decided, all patients undergo another imaging study (CT simulation \[CT-sim\]) in which patient's head is placed in a reproducible position, and endure a moulding procedure to create a personalized plastic mask for securing the patient's head in a fixed position during the CT acquisition, and reproduced at the subsequent radiation treatment sessions. Typical wait times between moulding, CT-sim and the first radiation treatment is 3-7 days. If a method would be available to accurately recreate the patient's position during diagnostic imaging and reproduce it during radiation treatments without the need for a moulding session or CT-sim, the treatment process can be streamlined and wait times shortened for patients.

Previous studies using 3D printing technology in radiotherapy (such as brachytherapy applicators) have shown that these employed materials are safe for use in clinical settings, and 3D printers can accurately produce devices of various shapes and sizes for clinical use.

In this study, we propose a novel workflow in which patient's position at diagnostic imaging is reproduced with a 3D-printed patient-specific immobilization device, enabling the use of the same diagnostic imaging for planning purposes in lieu of dedicated simulation and moulding sessions, to decrease wait times for patients between diagnostic imaging and start of radiation treatment.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04114786,imaging; surgery,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

IL13-PE38QQR is a tumor-targeting agent administered by a continuous infusion directly into the brain around the cavity where the tumor has been removed. Through previous research, this Study Drug has shown potential to control some of the recurrent malignant gliomas, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma.

The Study Drug is made by combining a human protein (IL13) with a portion of a bacterial toxin protein, Pseudomonas Exotoxin (PE). The IL13 portion binds to receptors on the tumor like a ""key to a lock,"" allowing the PE portion to enter and kill those cells. Since tumor cells preferentially bind the drug, normal (healthy) brain cells are much less likely to be damaged by the drug. The Study Drug is delivered through tubing or catheters placed directly into the area surrounding the resection cavity. These catheters will be surgically placed from 2-7 days after the tumor has been removed. A pump is then used to slowly push the drug solution through the catheters using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over a period of 4 days.

The GLIADEL® Wafer is an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and sold for the treatment of recurrent or newly diagnosed GBM. Patients receiving GLIADEL® will have wafers placed at the time of surgery to remove tumor.

Eligible patients enrolled in the PRECISE trial will be randomly assigned to receive either IL13-PE38QQR or GLIADEL® Wafer.

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving vaccine therapy together with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme recovering from lymphopenia caused by temozolomide.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate the feasibility and safety of vaccination with cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65-lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP) mRNA-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) during recovery from therapeutic temozolomide-induced lymphopenia with or without autologous lymphocyte transfer (ALT) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme and who are seropositive or seronegative for CMV.

Secondary

* To assess humoral and cellular immune responses in these patients to CMV pp65-LAMP mRNA-loaded dendritic cell (CMV-DC) vaccine and to compare the impact of ALT and CMV seropositivity on these parameters.
* To determine if vaccination with or without ALT extends total time to progression or overall survival of these patients when compared to a recent historical cohort.
* To assess the differential ability of indium In\^111-labeled DCs to track to the inguinal lymph nodes under different skin preparative conditions.
* To assess the differential ability of \^111In-labeled DCs to track to lymph nodes on the tumor-bearing and non-tumor-bearing side of the cervical lymph nodes.
* To characterize immunologic cell infiltrate in recurrent tumors and seek evidence of antigen escape in recurrent or progressive tumors.

Patients undergo leukapheresis no more than 4 weeks after surgical resection to obtain peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) for human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-autologous lymphocyte transfer (ALT) and CMV-dendritic cell (DC) generation.

Beginning 2-6 weeks after resection, patients undergo external beam radiotherapy (RT) once daily, 5 days a week, for up to 7 weeks. Beginning on day 1 of RT, patients receive oral temozolomide (TMZ) once daily for up to 49 days. Patients with progressive disease during RT, dependence on steroids above physiologic levels, intolerance to TMZ, or failure to meet cell release criteria for DCs or PBLs are removed from study.

Beginning within 2-4 weeks after completion of concurrent RT and TMZ, patients resume oral TMZ once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 6 courses\* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 19-23 of course 1, patients also receive an intradermal immunization. Patients are stratified by CMV serology status (positive vs negative) and are randomized to 1 of 2 vaccine treatment arms.

Note: \*Patients may receive additional TMZ treatment at the discretion of the patient and their treating neuro-oncologist.

* Arm I (DC vaccination plus ALT): Patients receive CMV-ALT IV over 45-90 minutes (course 1 only) and 2 x 10\^7 CMV pp65-LAMP mRNA-loaded DC (CMV-DC) vaccine intradermally and administered in equal portions to each inguinal region. Vaccination repeats every 1-3 weeks for up to 3 doses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II (DC vaccination alone): Patients receive CMV-DC vaccine as in arm I. At approximately 2-6 weeks after the third vaccination, all patients undergo a second leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells for immunologic monitoring and additional DCs for continued vaccinations. Patients may undergo an additional leukapheresis if they achieve a positive immunological response to therapy or if they require additional DCs to be generated due to a prolonged progression-free survival. Leukapheresis may be performed monthly, but will likely be performed every 4 months throughout the study to generate enough DCs to continue monthly vaccinations.
* Additional cohort (GM-CSF): Patients receive CMV-DC vaccine as in arm II, except that they will also receive GM-CSF in each vaccine. Vaccines continue for a total of 10 unless tumor progression occurs. Patients in this cohort may be enrolled at any point prior to completion of adjuvant TMZ provided they meet all other eligibility criteria.

Prior to the fourth vaccination, patients in both arms and patients with disease progression determined prior to the first scheduled vaccination are stratified according to side of inguinal injection (left vs right) and vaccination skin site preparation (unpulsed DCs vs tetanus toxoid). Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I (unpulsed DCs): Within 6 to 24 hours prior to vaccination, patients undergo skin site preparation with 1 x 10\^6 unpulsed DCs at the vaccination site in one inguinal region. Patients then receive indium In\^111-labeled CMV-DC.
* Arm II (tetanus toxoid): Within 6 to 24 hours prior to vaccination, patients undergo vaccination skin site preparation in the opposite inguinal region with tetanus toxoid. Patients then receive indium In\^111-labeled CMV-DC as in arm I.

At the time of progression, patients receive a final intradermal vaccination comprising \^111In-labeled CMV-DCs at the base of the jaw bilaterally and to the inguinal region, as a control. Gamma camera images are then taken at 24 and 48 hours after the vaccination to compare DC migration in the groin to each side of the neck injection sites and to observe migration from the neck injection sites to the deep and superficial cervical lymph nodes.

After completion of TMZ therapy, patients continue receiving DC vaccinations in the absence of disease progression (except GM-CSF cohort - total of 10 vaccinations).

Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for immunologic studies. Samples are examined for functional CD4 and CD8 immune response of patients by cytokine fluorescent cytometry; enumeration of pp65 antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by tetramer analysis; antigen-induced T-cell proliferation; cytokine secretion and quantitative anti-pp65 antibody concentration in the serum by ELISA; and CMV pp65 quantitation in genomic DNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Patients may also undergo stereotactic biopsy or tumor resection to confirm tumor progression histologically and to assess immunologic cell infiltration and pp65 antigen escape at the tumor site by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction.

Quality of life is assessed by the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain questionnaire at initial leukapheresis, at the first vaccination, after the third vaccination at the time of post-vaccine leukapheresis, and then with every even-numbered vaccination thereafter. A neuropsychological assessment is also conducted prior to the first vaccine and then with every second vaccination thereafter in order to monitor for any changes in neurocognitive or affective changes.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00639639,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

IL3-PE38QQR is a protein that exhibits cell killing activity against a variety of IL13 receptor-positive tumor cell lines indicating that it may show a therapeutic benefit. In reciprocal competition experiments, the interaction between IL13-PE38QQR and the IL13 receptors was shown to be highly specific for human glioma cells.

Patients will receive IL13-PE38QQR via a catheter placed directly into the brain tumor. Tumor recurrence will be confirmed by biopsy. The next day, patients will start a continuous 48-hour infusion of IL13-PE38QQR into the tumor. The dose (concentration) will be increased in the pre-resection infusion until the endpoint is reached (histologic evidence of tumor cytotoxicity or a maximum tolerated dose). Tumor resection will be planned for one week after biopsy, plus or minus 1 day. A histologically-effective concentration (HEC) will be determined using pathologic observations. At the end of resection, three catheters will be placed in brain tissue next to the resection site and assessed within 24 hours using MRI. On the second day after surgery, IL13-PE38QQR infusion will begin and will continue for 4 days. The lowest pre-resection IL13-PE38QQR concentration will be used as the starting dose for post-resection infusions. After an HEC or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, the pre-resection infusion will no longer be administered. Subsequent patients will have tumor resection and placement of three peri-tumoral catheters at study entry. IL13-PE38QQR will be infused starting on the second day after surgery and continuing for 4 days. Escalation of the post-resection IL13-PE38QQR concentration will be continued until the previously-defined HEC or MTD is reached, after which duration of the post-resection infusion will be increased in one day increments for up to 6 days. If a post-resection MTD is obtained, there will be no increase in duration of infusion. In the final stage of the study, catheters will be placed 2 days after tumor resection, and a 4-day IL13-PE38QQR infusion will begin the day after catheter placement. Patients will be observed clinically and radiographically for toxicity and duration of tumor control.","OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the concentration of IL13-PE38QQR that produces histologic evidence of toxicity to tumor, and the corresponding drug toxicity, following a 2-day continuous infusion into recurrent malignant glioma prior to surgical resection.

II. Determine the toxicity of IL13-PE38QQR administered as a 4-day continuous infusion via catheters into brain adjacent to tumor resection site, after surgical resection, at concentrations up to the selected concentration.

III. Determine the toxicity of increasing duration of continuous infusion of IL13- PE38QQR via catheters into brain adjacent to tumor resection site, after surgical resection, at the selected concentration.

IV. Determine the feasibility and safety of IL13-PE38QQR administration following post-operative placement of stereotaxic catheters 2 days after tumor resection, utilizing a post-operative imaging study for planning of catheter placement. A 4-day continuous infusion at the MTD is planned.

V. Describe the time to progression and survival of patients treated with IL13-PE38QQR.

PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This study is designed to determine two dose levels. The first is defined as the histologically effective concentration (HEC) when the agent is administered prior to tumor resection. The second is defined using safety and tolerability of study drug administered after tumor resection at doses up to the HEC. Safety and tolerability of increasing duration of infusion after tumor resection will then be assessed.

Patient cohorts will be treated at escalating pre-resection dose-levels until a stopping criterion for the pre-surgery dose is met, holding the post-resection dose constant at the starting level. Stopping criteria for dose escalation of the pre-surgery infusion are determination of the HEC or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

Subsequent cohorts will be treated only post-operatively at escalating dose levels until a stopping criterion for the post-surgery dose is met. Stopping criteria for dose escalation of the post-surgery infusion are reaching the HEC determined for the pre-operative infusion or determination of the MTD. After the HEC is reached, subsequent cohorts will be treated with post-operative infusions of increasing duration at the HEC until the maximum duration defined in the study is reached or an MTD is defined. (If an MTD has already detected, duration will not be escalated.)

After the stage of the study evaluating escalation of infusion duration has completed, the study will expand to evaluate post-operative placement of catheters after tumor resection. This stage of the study will assess the feasibility and safety of stereotaxic placement of catheters 2 days after tumor resection using a post-operative imaging study for planning. Patients will receive a 96 hour post-resection infusion at the MTD.

Cohorts of at least three patients will be entered at each dose level. Each cohort will be observed for at least thirty days after completion of administration of study drug to allow for observation of toxicity before the next cohort is enrolled.

Caregivers report impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and high distress. They even may experience significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression than patients themselves . Furthermore, Boele et al. showed that the overall survival in glioblastoma patients is associated with family caregivers' mastery.

In newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the EF-14 RCT demonstrated significantly prolonged survival in patients treated with TTFields compared to controls, with a median overall survival (OS) of 20.9 vs 16.0 months.

Several studies showed an important association of the daily compliance rate with OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Family caregivers' support might be associated to the patients' compliance and adequate support is required. However, so far rare supportive programs for patients and their caregivers have been established. It has been shown that delivery of supportive care via telehealth is feasible, however studies examining the effectiveness, adoption and maintenance of telehealth interventions in glioblastoma patients and family caregivers are still lacking. The aim is to improve patients' compliance to TTFields therapy by a psychological video intervention.

It is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial.

Main inclusion criteria are:

* Diagnosis of a GBM/being a GBM patient's caregiver
* Patients eligible for radiochemotherapy with TMZ and 60Gy
* Tumorboard recommendation for TTFields therapy
* Access to a computer and internet
* Absence of medical reasons precluding participation in a supportive intervention

The experimental intervention is:

Delivery of supportive care via telehealth intervention (including a brief psychological intervention and information/educational support regarding the disease, therapy and self-help options) in family caregivers and patients

The intervention encompasses six interventions (video call) for patients and caregivers.

The six sessions will be conducted by the psychologists of the coordinating center to allow homogeneous and sound implementation of the BPI. All psychologists are certified psychooncologists.

The first part of the sessions is scheduled immediately after start of radiochemotherapy (+ 2 weeks) in order to guide patients and caregivers in this important phase after first diagnose.

* First session/week 1 (+ 2 weeks) after start of radiochemotherapy: Engage and motivate patients and caregivers to participate and to develop open communication (60-90min), followed by a follow up phone call a few days later.
* Second session/week 2 (+ 2 weeks) after start of radiochemotherapy: Review of the last session and follow-up phone. Education on the techniques for optimistic attitude (including positive self-talk, positive thinking, and speaking positive). Discussion about necessity of setting achievable short-term goals in treatment process. Homework: ""Write at least 3 achievable short-term goals"" (45 min), followed by a follow up phone call a few days later.

The second part of the sessions is scheduled after completion of radiochemotherapy phase (+ 2 weeks) with focus in the adjuvant temozolomide therapy and TTFields therapy.

* Third session/week 7 (+ 2 weeks) after completed radiochemotherapy: Review of the last session, discussion over the phone, and homework. Providing information or advice about treatment, the TTFields therapy and medication.

  * Responding to hopelessness (focusing on positive details of the clinical course, the progress which patients made since surgery, but also sharing fears, and negative thoughts). Sharing community resources (websites, hospitals, and counseling centers).
  * Importance of TTFields therapy and association of daily compliance rate with prognosis, FAQ list, recommendations and practical aspects
  * Homework: ""Provide a list of supportive resources in your community"" ""Provide a list of questions to the health care professionals"" (45-60min), followed by a follow up phone call a few days later.
* Fourth session/week 8 (+ 2 weeks) after completed radiochemotherapy:

  * Education on the techniques for stress management (including physical activity, social contact/relationship, spending time in activity and nature (60-90 minutes) and healthy lifestyle behaviors.
  * Questions regarding TTFields and chemotherapy
  * Homework: ""List the useful strategies to manage your stress during the treatment process of your partner"", ""Apply stress management techniques"". (45-60min), followed by a follow up phone call a few days later.
* Fifth session/week 9 (+ 2 weeks) after completed radiochemotherapy:

  * First assessment after start of TTFields therapy, evaluation of practical questions and well-being
  * Education of self-care strategies (including eating well-balanced meals, permission to feel bad-schedule it in your day, permission to feel good, put off major life decisions (if it is possible), take breaks from periods of isolation, exercise - even a little bit, and let yourself cry (45-60 min).
* Sixth session/week 10 (+ 2 weeks) after completed radiochemotherapy: Feedback regarding the sessions before and planning of implementation of the learned strategies for the upcoming months. Homework: ""List the strategies personally useful and what personally motivates you, learned in the last weeks""

The control condition is: Standard of care with standard access to psychosocial support in certified Neuro-Oncological Centers

Potential participants will be identified via clinical protocol chart review of patients scheduled to attend their predetermined follow-up consultations at The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRT-BTC) at Duke University Medical Center after evaluation of treatment for newly diagnosed high grade gliomas. We will identify high grade glioma patients that will receive standard chemoradiation (radiotherapy with daily temozolomide dosed at 75 mg/m2). After obtaining written informed consent, all participants will be scheduled for baseline study assessments before starting radiotherapy. Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo or low dose naltrexone (LDN) dosed at 4.5 mg orally to be taken every evening before going to bed. Patients will be assessed at the following time points: 1. Baseline (before chemoradiation), 2. After chemoradiation (approximately 8 weeks from initial assessment), 3. Two months after standard chemoradiation (approximately 16 weeks after initial assessment), and 4. Four months after standard chemoradiation (approximately 24 weeks after initial assessment). Treatment with LDN or placebo will begin on first day of chemoradiation and will be continued for a total of 16 weeks from initial assessment. Last assessment at 24 weeks will occur 8 weeks after discontinuation of LDN or placebo. All visits will be linked to patients' clinical management visits. All testing will be performed at PRT-BTC and at Duke University Medical Center.

The following procedures will be obtained at each assessment visit:

1. Complete a six-minute walk test. The exercise test is designed to determine how far the subject can walk in six minutes. This test will take place at the PRT-BTC at Duke University Medical Center with appropriate medical supervision.
2. Blood testing that will be performed as part of each clinic visit. Approximately 10 milliliters or 2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn at each visit. This will not be additional blood work, but rather the standardized blood work that the subject will need for evaluation associated with radiation and chemotherapy treatments.

We will ask the subject to complete the following tests/questionnaires:

1. Neurocognitive testing: this testing will be performed using a computer program called CNS Vital Signs®. This program consists of verbal and visual memory tests, attention tests, reasoning tests, and speed of processing tests. The subject will use a laptop computer to complete these tests. No previous exposure to computers or computer testing is needed to complete the test.
2. Computerized Questionnaires: Four questionnaires will be presented using a computerized program. These will include Medical Outcomes Survey (MOS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). MOS assesses general health, well-being, and quality of life. ESS asks about level of sleepiness while PSQI asks about sleep quality. Finally, ZSDS will evaluate feelings of depression and sadness.
3. Beck depression inventory (BDI): This questionnaire asks questions about the subject's levels of sadness, changes in the subject's mood, sleeping and eating patterns, the subject's level of interest in activities, thoughts and feelings the subject is having and the subject's level of concentration. This is a pen and paper questionnaire.
4. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR) scale: This questionnaire asks questions about physical, function, emotional, and social well-being. This is a pen and paper questionnaire.
5. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale: This questionnaire asks questions about fatigue. This is a pen and paper questionnaire.

The safety of the drug combinations will also be studied.,"The Study Drugs:

Lenalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. This may decrease or prevent the growth of cancer cells.

Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply the nutrients needed for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells. Bevacizumab is no longer FDA approved to treat breast cancer.

Sorafenib is designed to block the function of important proteins in cancer cells. These proteins, when active, are in part responsible for the abnormal growth and behavior of cancer cells.

Temsirolimus is designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells to die.

FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) is a drug combination designed to kill rapidly dividing cells by stopping DNA (the genetic material of cells) from duplicating. Because of a pharmacy shortage of IV leucovorin, patients will continue treatment without leucovorin until it becomes available.

Study Groups (Arms):

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 4 study arms. Each study arm will receive lenalidomide in combination with 1 of the 4 drugs/drug combinations described in the ""Study Drugs"" section above. The arm you are assigned to will depend on what arms are still open and what your doctor thinks is appropriate for you. Your doctor will consider the type of disease you have, other drugs you have received for the disease, and any side effects you may have seen with other drugs when deciding which arm you should be assigned to:

* If you are in Arm 1, you will receive lenalidomide and bevacizumab.
* If you are in Arm 2, you will receive lenalidomide and sorafenib.
* If you are in Arm 3, you will receive lenalidomide and temsirolimus.
* If you are in Arm 4, you will receive lenalidomide and FOLFOX.

Up to 4 dose levels of the drug combination will be tested for each arm. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level in each arm. For each arm, the first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose for the drug combination is found for each arm. After the highest tolerable dose of the drug combination is found, an additional 20 patients will be able to receive this combination dose in each arm.

Study Drug Administration:

If you are in Arm 1, 2, or 3, each study ""cycle"" will be 28 days. If you are in Arm 4, each study cycle will be 21 days.

Injections will be placed with careful avoidance of penetration of the ventricular system or any significant vascular structures, and any of the already-placed catheters. Intraoperative ultrasound will be used as needed to define positions of structures or catheters to avoid. After each inoculation the needle will be left in place for up to two minutes before removal and, after removal, the entry site will be covered with hemostatic agent. Both of these measures should minimize reflux of inoculum back into the tumor cavity. Before closing the dura, a fifth catheter will be left in place and then anchored with a Rickham in the tumor resection cavity to allow later access for CSF collection. This Rickham will not be used for M032 administration. The surgical procedure will then be completed in standard fashion. If ventricular entry has occurred during surgery, no M032 will be administered intraoperatively. Instead, a post-operative CT scan will be obtained on Day 1, and the initial M032 dose will be administered as outlined below, using all catheters felt to be appropriately positioned adjacent to the tumor cavity without violating the constraints of the exclusion criteria.

Pembrolizumab treatment and subsequent treatments of M032. Starting at week four, patients will undergo treatment on the same day, and every three weeks thereafter, with intra-venous infusion of 200mg of Pembrolizumab (for dosing detail, see Section 5.2.1). A total of 3 combined doses of Pembrolizumab and M032 will be given. Patients will then undergo treatment with inoculation of the calculated total dose of M032 as follows: each total dose (1 x 105 pfu for dose level one, 1 x 106 pfu for dose level two) directly into the remaining tumor bed at the time of craniotomy and immediately after resection for a particular dose level will be divided into up to four aliquots depending on the number of catheters available for inoculation. Each aliquot will be 1ml in total volume, consisting of 0.5 ml of M032 and will be infused over two minutes after puncture of each individual reservoir with a 22-24 g needle (using sterile techniques, after sterile preparation of the overlying scalp), followed by 0.5 ml of preservative free saline.

Determination of the suitability of each reservoir/catheter for inoculation will be made by the PI before each dosing and will include known patency status of each catheter, location of catheter tip and degree of adherence to the placement guidelines described above; 3) concerns for associated neurotoxicity related to M032 and/or inflammation in area of a particular reservoir/catheter tip; and 4) availability of other catheters for inoculation. Catheters whose reservoir(s) are closely associated with overlying scalp infections/inflammation will not be injected. Each catheter will be gently aspirated after the Rickham has been accessed but prior to M032 inoculation; catheters from which CSF can be aspirated will not be inoculated to avoid inoculation into the CSF space. The MRI obtained immediately prior to assessment (see schedule, below) will be used to help inform the decision-making above. If there is any question regarding reservoir/catheter suitability, an additional CT or MRI may be obtained prior to inoculation at the PI's discretion.

Combined Pembrolizumab and M032 treatments at each dose level will be repeated at three-week intervals for up to three cycles total, or until unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression occurs. Patients who are responding to treatment may be considered for additional dosing after the trial period has been completed.

The first two patients treated will not require any waiting period between enrollments. If one of the two should develop a toxicity, the third and subsequent (up to six) patients at that level will not be enrolled until seven weeks from the initial dose of M032 and three weeks from the first combined dose of Pembrolizumab and M032 has transpired for the initial two patients and every patient thereafter, to allow adequate duration of time for development of potential dose limiting toxicities in each treated patient before treating the next patient at that level.

Patients will undergo and then subsequently with each dose of Pembrolizumab; i If one toxicity occurs at a given dose level, that cohort will be increased to 6 patients. If 2 or more toxicities occur at the tested dose level, then with the approval of the DSMB, the dose will be de-escalated by one log and a new cohort enrolled with similar rules at the level. If 2 or more toxicities occur at the de-escalated dose level, then the DSMB will be consulted to determine if a stopping rule should be invoked or consideration of further dose de-escalation should be considered. The investigators anticipate as few as four patients (given two or more DLTs initially) and as many as 12 (only one DLT at each dose level). However, based on experience with M032 and Pembrolizumab, the investigators expect that this combination will not pro-duce any dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).

Phase I/Cohort II: Having established for the safety and tolerability of M032 in conjunction with Pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent Malignant Glioma (MG), the trial will immediately transition into a Phase I Cohort II study of Pembrolizumab and M032 in patients with newly diagnosed MG. Patients who are previously untreated but suspected of having a high grade glioma by MRI and are eligible for craniotomy and resection will be offered participation in this two-Cohort trial. As in Phase I Cohort I, for the Phase I/Cohort II, consented subjects will have safe gross total resection, implantation of up to four Rickham catheters in the peritumoral brain and M032 injected into the wall of the resection cavity as described above.

Patients will be treated with a total dose of of M032 initially at the time of craniotomy as determined in Cohort I, above. They will then undergo treatment with standard fractionated radiation, and temozolomide as determined by treating physician. Starting at week four, patients will undergo treatment on the same day, and every three weeks thereafter, with intra-venous infusion of 200mg of Pembrolizumab (for dosing detail, see Section 5.2.1) and intratumoral M032 (via the Rickham-catheters placed at the periphery of the tumor cavity-the catheter left in the tumor cavity itself will not be used for M032 inoculation, but only to access CSF). Patients will then undergo treatment with inoculation of the calculated total dose of M032 for that dose level divided into up to four aliquots depending on the number of catheters available for inoculation. Each aliquot will be 1ml in total volume, consisting of 0.5 ml of M032 and will be infused over 2 minutes after puncture of each individual reservoir with a 22-24 g needle (using sterile techniques, after sterile preparation of the over-lying scalp).

Determination of the suitability of each reservoir/catheter for inoculation will be made by the PI before each dosing and will include known patency status of each catheter, location of catheter tip and degree of adherence to the placement guidelines described above; 3) concerns for associated neurotoxicity related to M032 and/or inflammation in area of a particular reservoir/catheter tip; and 4) availability of other catheters for inoculation.

Phase II: Having established for the safety and tolerability of M032 in conjunction with Pembrolizumab in patients with newly-diagnosed MG, the trial will immediately transition into a Phase II study of Pembrolizumab and M032 in patients with newly diagnosed MG. Patients who are previously untreated but suspected of having a high grade glioma by MRI and are eligible for craniotomy and resection will be offered participation in this two-Cohort trial. Unlike the Phase I, patients will be eligible to receive Pembrolizumab and M032 every 3 weeks for up to one year. The Phase II design will employ the Simon two-stage optimal study design. It will be a single-arm open-label study of M032+ pembrolizumab and the primary endpoints of Over-all Survival at 12 months and 24 months, and Progression Free Survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6). In the first stage, 6 patients will be accrued. Data will be allowed to mature, and an interim analysis per-formed at that time. During this period, additional subjects may be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer responses in the initial 6 patients, further accrual to the study may be stopped. Otherwise, 10 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 16. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 11 or more responses are observed in 16 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 80% when the PFS-6 is 75%. To allow for 25% unevaluable subjects, a maximum of 22 subjects will be enrolled.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05084430,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Gliomas can be classified into different types based on tumor grade, histopathological features, and molecular characteristics. The common types of diffuse gliomas include glioblastoma, astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma. The standard treatment for diffuse gliomas includes surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. As per standard institutional practice, a uniform dose of radiation is delivered to the disease area and MRI is done before and after the treatment. In this study, MRI and PET scan will be done before starting the treatment and standard dose of radiation will be delivered. The interval imaging will be done twice during the course of treatment with MRI and PET, followed by dose modifications. The CT, MRI, and PET will be combined. Based on PET imaging, specific dose will be altered and delivered to specific areas. Dose modification will be done with the help of artificial intelligence. Participant's assessment will be done at regular intervals.

Modifications in radiation plans are done based on the changes in disease seen in scans is likely to improve the accuracy of RT treatments. Dose modifications based on imaging to resistant areas will help achieve better tumor control, reduce treatment-related toxicities, precise delivery of the RT and adjusting doses to the organs at risk (OAR) and changes in disease leading to better treatment compliance. Creating an artificial intelligence framework in radiation oncology promises to improve quality of workflow, treatment planning and RT delivery.

The aim of the study is to develop an artificial intelligence workflow for treatment of glioma with adaptive radiotherapy. This study will be conducted in Tata Memorial Centre on a population of 60 patients for a duration of 2 years. The total study duration is 4 years.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents grade 4 diffuse gliomas accounting for the most common primary malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults . GBM is treated with radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent chemotherapy following maximal safe resection, with a median survival of approximately 15-18 months . GBM harbors significant intratumoral heterogeneity with areas of multiclonal and hypoxic areas rendering higher chances of disease relapse following standard RT .

Similarly, distinct compartments can be well appreciated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): enhancing tumor core (TC) with central necrotic areas and the peritumoral region (PTR), which consists of microscopic tumor infiltration and vasogenic edema . Similar to regions of radioresistant areas within the TC, the microscopic disease in the PTR plays a vital role in disease relapse . Other grade 2 and 3 diffuse gliomas include isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma . In the recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification of CNS tumors, molecular information is combined with histopathological information for integrated classification. IDH-wildtype tumors are further molecularly characterized and considered as GBM since the prognosis is shown to be dismal. Oligodendrogliomas are confirmed based on the presence of deletion of 1p19q chromosomal arms. Grade 2/3 diffuse gliomas are typically seen as tumors with T2-weighted hyperintense tumors. The treatment is similar to GBM, with maximal safe resection followed by radiation and concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy.

Radiotherapy for Diffuse Gliomas Radiotherapy (RT) forms an integral role in the multimodality management of diffuse gliomas . Radiation is indicated in low-grade gliomas with high-risk features or high-grade gliomas following maximal safe resection . The radiation (RT) in diffuse gliomas in GBM is delivered using conformal techniques to the residual disease and cavity, called the gross tumor volume (GTV). The surrounding area is included in the clinical target volume (CTV) to treat areas of microscopic disease. For GBM, an expansion of 1.5 -2 cm is done from the GTV, which is identified as an enhancing area on T1c sequences to include areas of PTR (T2w hyperintensity) and edited from anatomical barriers like meninges and dural reflections . For IDH-mutant gliomas, the residual tumor and cavity (identified as T2w hyperintensity region) are included as GTV and further expansion of 5-10 mm is done to be included as CTV . The standard practice involves delivering a uniform dose of radiation to the planning target volume (PTV), which encompasses an isotropic margin expansion surrounding the CTV to account for set-up uncertainties. In GBM and IDHmutant high-grade astrocytoma, the total dose of 59.4-60 Gy is delivered over 6-7 weeks with 1.8-2 Gy per fraction. A relatively lower dose of radiation, in the range of 54.0-59.4 Gy, is delivered over 6-7 weeks using 1.8-2 Gy per fraction for oligodendrogliomas. As per the current paradigm, radiation is planned on computed tomography (CT) for dose computation and MRI for visualization of target volumes and organs at risk (OAR), done once before treatment, based on which fractionated radiation is delivered over 6- 7 weeks. Recent evidence with MRI undertaken during the course of treatment has demonstrated the changes in dynamics of the residual disease, surgical cavity, and also the OARs in a proportion of patients, suggesting that treatment is delivered based on imaging at a single time-point can lead to inaccuracies .Therefore, adaptive radiotherapy (ART) to modify radiation plans based on the spatial changes of the target volume and OAR is likely to improve the accuracy of RT treatments. Also, serial imaging during treatment can be used to identify areas of tumor or PTR showing refractory disease or vasogenic edema, with provisions for biological modifications of RT doses . The use of conformal radiation techniques like intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can enable delivery of differential radiation doses precisely to different areas of the target volume, known as dose painting .Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) has attained wide popularity in oncology in disease staging, identifying hypoxic areas, and guiding radiation planning . For gliomas, amino acid PET like O-(2-\[18F\] fluoroethyl) -L-tyrosine (FET) or Fluorodopa (F-DOPA) has been proven effective with areas of a higher tumor to white matter ratio, suggestive areas of active disease (19) . The use of PET scans during treatment can help identify areas refractory to RT, reflected by higher uptake of the radioisotope. Higher doses to such regions provide a window for biological adaption and can potentially improve control rates. Similarly, quantitative analysis of imaging (more popularly known as radiomics) can help differentiate areas of microscopic tumor from vasogenic edema in the PTR, which otherwise appears similar to conventional imaging . Artificial Intelligence The role of artificial intelligence in oncology is increasingly recognized, ranging from optimization of healthcare resource utilization and decision-making to quantitative image analysis for prognostication and the potential ability to serve as a noninvasive biomarker . The practice of contemporary radiation oncology heavily relies on the interaction of humans and machines in almost every treatment planning process, including contouring of target volumes, OAR, treatment-planning processes, and during treatment delivery. Creating an artificial intelligence framework in radiation oncology promises to improve workflow efficiency and accuracy and enable treatment planning and delivery rapidly and efficiently. The use of adaptive radiotherapy will be further facilitated using machine learning algorithms with appropriate identification of patients to be benefitted from volumetric or biological adaptation, autosegmentation of target/OAR, automated treatment planning, and biological modification based on spatial and temporal changes of quantitative imaging parameters. Standard institutional practice The standard institutional practice includes a dose of 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions over 6.5 weeks for patients with glioblastoma and 55.8 Gy in 31 fractions over 6 weeks for patients with oligodendroglioma. Concurrent temozolomide is used for all patients undergoing radiation at the dose of 75 mg/m 2 of body surface area during the course of radiation with weekly monitoring on blood counts. All radiation treatments are planned based on single time CT and MRI scan without any scheduled interval scans during radiation, and no adaptation is done. Adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide is started after 4 weeks of radiation completion at dose of 150 mg/m 2 for five days and repeated on monthly basis and dose escalated to 200 mg/m 2 if tolerating well and normal blood counts. As standard practice 6 and 12 cycles of temozolomide are scheduled for GBM and IDH-mutant glioma (astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma) respectively. After treatment completion clinical follow-up is scheduled every 3-6 months in the first 2 years and thereafter every 6-12 months for all the patients. Surveillance imaging is scheduled every 6-12 months in the first 5 years and thereafter on annual basis or interval imaging undertaken as prompted clinically.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06492486,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

This is commonly performed in Europe. There is an opportunity to develop this tracer for use in Ontario, specifically for accurate delineation of disease for therapy planning and for prediction of disease recurrence, which is difficult with conventional imaging and clinical assessment techniques. The goals of this project are to develop this tracer in our local setting for use in our patients, provide evidence in the Ontario setting of its utility in addressing these unmet needs, and provide pilot evidence for future clinical trials.

Gliomas are primary malignancies of the brain. The most aggressive and common form is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which accounts for more than 60% of all primary brain malignancies . The standard of care for patients with glioblastoma is maximally safe resection of the enhancing tumor regions and the necrotic core followed by radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide. MRI is widely accepted as the method of choice for treatment planning and for following these patients to predict and to detect recurrent disease.

High grade gliomas represent the most common primary brain malignancy and prognosis remains poor. The most common subtype is glioblastoma which has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 5% . Despite advances in MRI techniques, prediction and diagnosis of treatment failure remains a challenge. The result is frequent imaging mixed with uncertainty regarding the presence of viable tumor versus post-treatment effects. Furthermore, follow-up of these patients represents a high cost to the health system while symptom or disease control remains limited. A more accurate means identifying viable tumor is needed to guide management, reduce costs, and ultimately to improve patient survival and quality of life.

0-(2-18F-Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET) is an amino acid agent derived from tyrosine that is able to cross the blood brain barrier. It has been studied primarily in diagnosis and detection of tumor recurrence in glioblastomas with emerging evidence for its use in brain metastases.

The standard treatment involves surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ). The efficacy of TMZ, however, is significantly enhanced when the tumor's o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is methylated. Recent studies, such as the NOA-09 trial, have suggested that adding Lomustine (LOM) to TMZ could improve outcomes for patients with this specific tumor profile.

Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the addition of LOM to the TMZ regimen will lead to significantly improved survival rates among patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who have a methylated MGMT promoter compared to those receiving only TMZ.

Treatment Plans: The study will randomly assign participants to two groups:

* Control Group: Standard treatment with TMZ during and after radiation therapy.
* Experimental Group: TMZ combined with LOM, starting on the first day of radiation therapy.

Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure will be survival. Other outcomes will include progression-free survival (time from randomization until tumor progression or death), safety profiles (adverse effects of the treatments), and quality of life measures as well as neurocognitive outcomes.","Current evidence:

In this section the investigators highlight the evidence behind the current standard fo care, and the emerging data supporting our approach. The RCT of Stupp showed that radiotherapy (RT) together with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ prolong survival. The NORDIC trial investigated the role of TMZ compared to RT for the subgroup of elderly patients, showing that survival was superior with TMZ, especially for those with mMGMT. LOM has been used for treatment of glioma for many decades, often used in combination with procarbazine and vincristine (PCV), but in recent years it is used in patients with glioblastoma as 2nd line therapy after failure of TMZ.

A phase 3 trial with Tumor Treating Fields (TTF, alternating low intensity electromagnetic fields) showed prolonged survival in patients with glioblastoma, but it is not universally applied/approved. Despite full multimodal treatment with surgery, RT, TMZ and TTFields, the median survival is \<2 years. There is an unmet medical need to further improve treatments for these patients.

One RCT (NOA-09) provided preliminary data to exploit the specific vulnerability of mMGMT in glioblastoma (although no use of TTF in this trial). The overall tolerability of TMZ-LOM in combination was acceptable, as most adverse events (AE) were moderate and transient. Furthermore, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and neurocognition did not differ between groups.

Estimated sample size and power:

Sample size calculation is based upon the results from the CeTeG/NOA-09 trial. Accounting for attrition, a total of 200 mMGMT GBM patients have to be randomised. Patients that drop-out before start of any therapy will be replaced, which will lead to more than 200 patients being randomized. For overall survival (OS) all patients that started day 1 of radiochemotherapy will be analysed (modified ITT). For per protocol all patients that have completed week 6 of treatment arm will be analysed for outcome. Patients lost to follow-up after the start of chemotherapy will be evaluated as observations censored at the time of dropout. Approximately 45% of newly diagnosed patients have a mMGMT, thus for 200 randomised patients a minimum of 445 patients will be screened.

Addition to the already described statistics:

Randomizations are stratified for center and for TTFields. The primary confirmatory analysis will be based on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population.

Survival parameters are measured in days starting from the day of randomization. Median time estimates as well as 95% confidence intervals will be reported. All additional analyses will be descriptive.

The statistical analysis plan (SAP) and blinding of statisticians will ensure analytic transparency and robustness.

Finally, similarly to avoid producing outdated results, the investigators plan to start TTF concomitant according to the Trident trial where results are expected soon. Nevertheless, if the Trident results are negative, the investigators will submit an amendment for using TTF according to the current standard of care. The reverse would not be possible in the middle of the trial as this has required extensive discussion, planning, and training with all sites. Balance with respect to TTF use is ensured with stratification in the randomization process.

The main questions to answer are:

* Whether the new treatment protocol (Elemene plus Stupp Protocol) is clinically safe for ndGBM patients.
* Whether the new treatment protocol (Elemene plus Stupp Protocol) brings better survival benefits for ndGBM patients compared to the standard-of-care Stupp Protocol.

Study participants will be enrolled in 5 hospitals in China and randomly assigned to receive either the new protocol or the standard protocol. The overall survival (OS) rate in the 12th month, the progression-free survival (PFS) rate in the 6th month, OS, PFS, and adverse events assessed by the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) will be evaluated for all patients.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is a WHO grade 4 adult-type diffuse glioma and the most common malignant, primary brain tumor with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of only \~5% in real-world studies. The Stupp Protocol, consisting of fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days/week for 6 weeks (a total of 60 Gy), plus concomitant daily temozolomide (TMZ, 75 mg/m2/day, 7 days/week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy) after maximal safe tumor resection, followed by six cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150-200 mg/m2/day for 5 days during each 28-day cycle), has been adopted as the standard of care for patients with newly-diagnosed GBMs (ndGBMs) since 2005.

However, there have been no other treatment modalities except for tumor treating fields (TTFields) that have brought survival benefits for ndGBM patients during the past two decades. Since TTFields therapy is super expensive (about 1 million yuan/0.15 million dollars per year) and fewer than 10% of ndGBM patients can afford it around the globe, the Stupp Protocol is still being used as the first-line and the most widely-adopted treatment option for ndGBM patients around the world.

Elemene, a Chinese anti-tumor medicine extracted from the plant Curcuma Wenyujin, has been isolated as a monomeric drug and has a broad-spectrum anti-tumor effect in various cancers, such as lung cancer, breast carcinoma, leukemia, and ovarian cancer. In recent years, its application in GBMs as revealed in the preliminary retrospective studies published in Chinese Journals and a few English Journals have shown survival benefits with acceptable toxicity. Elemene can pass through the blood-brain barrier because of its small molecular weight and lipid solubility and has synergistic anti-tumor effects with TMZ and radiotherapy for GBM patients. Several in vitro studies also have shown that Elemene could inhibit GBM cell proliferation, promote cell differentiation, and induce cancer cell apoptosis.

All these findings from the above studies have indicated the potential survival benefits of Elemene in treating ndGBMs. However, so far, no clinical trials have tested the efficacy and safety of the new treatment protocol (Elemene added to the Stupp Protocol) for ndGBMs compared with the conventional Stupp protocol.

In this study, the investigators aimed to launch a multi-center, phase II, randomized, controlled clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of Elemene plus Stupp Protocol compared with Stupp Protocol alone for ndGBM patients.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05842746,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

This research may pave the way for improved clinical decision-making, personalized treatment approaches, and more accurate clinical trials for glioma patients.","Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) is an advanced imaging technique that measures the mechanical properties of tissues, providing valuable information about tissue stiffness, elasticity, and adhesion. In the case of gliomas, a type of brain tumor arising from glial cells, MRE has shown promising potential in the diagnosis, classification, and prediction of pathological and molecular features.

This clinical trial aims to investigate the relationship between tumor stiffness, adhesion, glioma grading, and genetic alterations by combining magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) imaging findings with molecular pathological analysis. Moreover, the study aims to predict patient survival based on the physical properties of the tumor.

Preoperatively, we will use MRE to enhance the accuracy of navigation and determine tumor stiffness and adhesion properties. Intraoperatively, under the guidance of neuronavigation, tissue samples will be obtained, and the operating surgeon will assess the tumor's stiffness, elasticity, and degree of adhesion.

Postoperatively, all tissue specimens will undergo molecular pathological analysis. The integration of MRE findings with molecular pathology data will enable precise classification and subtyping of gliomas.

Furthermore, all patients will receive systematic treatment after surgery, and long-term follow-ups will be conducted.

These brain tumors are typically treated by surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either individually or in combination. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months. Glioma is the most common form of primary brain cancer, afflicting approximately 7,000 patients in the United States each year.

The performance will be assessed by analysis of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and assessment of image quality by using the Surgeon Image Rating (SIR) Scale.

This is a prospective, multi-centre single-arm study where the performance of SonoClear ACF relative to routinely used acoustic coupling fluid is investigated by each patient being their own control. Patients with the diagnosis of HGG and LGG at up to 10 sites will be included. Additionally, safety data are collected at 30 days and 6 months post-procedure.","Ultrasound images will be obtained at different timepoints during the operation. First timepoint being after craniotomy (no fluids involved). Second timepoint being when some tumour is left in the bottom of the deeper part of the resection cavity (approximately 80% of tumour removed), and third timepoint being when the surgeon deems resection of the tumour to be completed. At the second and third timepoint ultrasound acquisition will be performed twice at each timepoint. Once with routinely used saline / Ringer's solution and once with SonoClear ACF.

There are two performance related primary endpoints, based on core lab assessments:

1. To show that ultrasound images obtained with SonoClear ACF are less influenced by image artefacts compared to images obtained with standard of care saline or Ringer´s solution, by measuring the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The CNR is a measure of the relative noise in the image. To achieve this endpoint, the use of SonoClear ACF must lead to superior image quality in comparison with Saline/Ringer´s solution. Superior image quality is defined as the CNR being statistically different between the images obtained with saline/Ringer and SonoClear ACF respectively, i.e., significantly less noise in the images obtained with SonoClear ACF.
2. To show that ultrasound images obtained with SonoClear ACF are of better quality compared to images obtained with standard of care Saline/Ringer's solution, by using a qualitative assessment, called the Surgeons Image Rating (SIR) scale. A Panel of Experts will assess the quality of the obtained images by answering 3 questions for each image. The SIR a 1-10 numeric rating scale, is used to measure the quality of the image according to three questions to be answered at the three different timepoints during the operation.

This SIR is designed to explore whether SonoClear ACF, having shown to provide better quantitative image quality in the CNR analysis, allows surgeons to detect this improved image quality. Eventually this improved image quality should result in better decision-making during surgery about margins of excision and residual tumour resection.

Primary Safety Endpoint

The primary safety hypothesis is to prove the primary safety event rate is less than 10%. The primary safety event is defined as any core lab determined major MRI finding when post-operative MRI is compared to pre-operative MRI that was found by the DMC to be serious and probably or definitely related to the study device OR any DMC determined serious adverse event that is probably or definitely related to the study device that occurs within 30 days of the procedure. Success is demonstrated by observing 0 of these events out of 37 subjects exposed to SonoClear ACF. This is equivalent to a two-sided p-value less 0.05 for the alternative hypothesis that the primary safety event rate in subjects undergoing tumor resection using ACF is less than 10%.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04734444,imaging; surgery,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

NCT03158389,Umbrella Protocol for Phase I/IIa Trials of Molecularly Matched Targeted Therapies Plus Radiotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Without MGMT Promoter Methylation: NCT Neuro Master Match - N²M² (NOA-20),COMPLETED,"['PHASE1', 'PHASE2']",INTERVENTIONAL,228,ACTUAL,"Wolfgang Wick, Prof. Dr. (University Hospital Heidelberg)",5/7/2018,2/22/2023,2/22/2023,University Hospital Heidelberg,"German Cancer Aid; German Cancer Research Center; National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg","Glioblastoma, Adult",APG101; Alectinib; Idasanutlin; Atezolizumab; Vismodegib; Temsirolimus; Palbociclib,18 years,,ALL,The objective of N²M² is the improvement of overall survival of patients with glioblastoma with an unmethylated MGMT promoter based on molecular characterization and use of targeted compounds in a modern trial design. The progression-free survival rate at six months (PFS-6) will be used to make decisions.,"Advances in the understanding of glioblastoma at a molecular level along with technological progress have led to the identification of key genetic alterations, not only in scientific projects but also in every-day clinical practice. These alterations increasingly refine the sub-classification of glioblastoma and the introduction of molecular markers in this classification, which ultimately may allow defining subset specific treatments.

The present umbrella concept for multiple biomarker-driven subtrials anchors at the Heidelberg-based INFORM registry trial in recurrent pediatric malignancies, where in analogy to NCT Neuro Master Match (N²M²) whole-exome, low-coverage whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing is used to identify targeted agents, single or in combinations according to a dedicated algorithm. It also shares conceptual similarities with international projects currently developed for lung and breast cancer. Finally, approaches to use molecular information in glioblastoma for the definition of a therapy at progression are also planned by the ""Defeat Glioma"" Consortium in the US and a group of excellence centers also in the US.

The N²M² concept excels the aforementioned initiatives in the strict focus on newly diagnosed patients, the option to cross-validate molecular biomarkers in an already analyzed contemporary cohort of glioblastoma patients analyzed in the German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK) and the use of a parallel group treated with standard-of-care (SOC). Further restriction is made by the inclusion of patients only with a low likelihood to benefit from the SOC, temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy on the basis of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, allowing to replace TMZ with a molecularly targeted agent in combination with radiotherapy (RT) in each of the experimental subtrials. Replacing TMZ by an experimental agent in the primary chemo-radiotherapy has been done in at least four completed trials, albeit without pre-selection of a targeted therapy but the more opportunistic use of an available drug with no known MGMT interaction. Focusing on newly diagnosed patients not only harbors the greater likelihood of impact on the disease, but also allows addressing questions on acquired resistance in the more likely obtained tumor tissue at recurrence.

N²M² is formally divided into a DISCOVERY and a TREATMENT aspect. DISCOVERY starts with an (epigenomewide) Illumina methylation array and a panel sequencing followed by an appropriate and accepted standard method (Sanger Sequencing or Immunohistochemistry) within the scope of these methods for target validation prior to any suggestion for patient allocation into one of the subtrials. Suggestions for patients' allocation to one of the subtrials will be based on results of accepted standard methods. These data will be generated from formaline-fixed paraffine embedded (FFPE) tissue within in 2-3 weeks after surgery. The Heidelberg site has already established the next generation gene panel sequencing (used for target discovery in case of N²M²) and genome wide DNA methylation analyses for aiding daily routine. To meet the criteria for a safe use of these data for decision-making the orthogonal, standard methods performed in the Institute of Pathology are supplemented.

DISCOVERY also includes the use of whole exome, low-coverage whole-genome, and transcriptome sequencing, the methylome analysis, and gene expression arrays to find new, unexpected targets and get a more comprehensive view on affected pathways. Discovery is also the driving force behind the work on resistant tumors. The latter may result in individual treatment decisions at recurrence, knowing there are no relevantly active treatments in this setting.

TREATMENT is driven by a match/no match decision rendered in an algorithm that will be subject to refinement in the process of the project, both by data generated in N²M², but also external evidence; i.e. there may be some linear relations between an alteration, e.g. BRAF V600E mutation and a distinct treatment or some others, but it is expected that these linear relations will be replaced in a learning system by relations that take upstream and downstream target alterations and also parallel signaling pathways into account and may therefore already predict a certain likelihood of resistance development.

In detail, FFPE tissue (and blood) from patients diagnosed with a glioblastoma harboring an unmethylated MGMT promoter after informed consent will be subjected to a (epigenomewide) methylation array and panel sequencing as well as the appropriate methods to validate any of the trial immanent targets, if they are present, with results available within a maximum of 3 weeks postoperatively. This allows for a timely decision at the molecular Neurooncology Tumor Board and a timely initiation (within 4 to 6 weeks) of the postoperative treatment. Further examinations on fresh tumor tissue (and blood) such as whole exome, low-coverage whole genome and transcriptome sequencing as well as expression arrays will be done to enhance the scientific background on the tumor tissue. These data will not be used for decision-making, Runs already done within the INFORM project with glioblastoma samples and also dry runs (n=43) for the N²M² project support the feasibility of the timelines and principal options for discovery.

Matching will be defined as a molecular situation, which makes treatment with RT and a matching targeted drug from a prespecified warehouse separated in subtrials meaningful. Patients will be informed about the identified treatment option within the ""matching"" open-label, parallel group Phase I/IIa trial. As for 2 of the experimental compounds (APG101 and Atezolizumab) no specific biomarker is validated at the moment, the nonmatching patients will be equally allocated to receive either APG101, Atezolizumab or the current SOC (radiochemotherapy with TMZ, TMZ-group). Patients allocated to the TMZ-group will serve as a meaningful control group with basic efficacy parameters documented, if consent has been obtained.

The objective of N²M² is the improvement of overall survival of patients with glioblastoma with an unmethylated MGMT promoter based on molecular characterization and use of targeted compounds in a modern trial design. The progression-free survival rate at six months (PFS-6) will be used to make decisions.

Parallel and ongoing translational projects within the DKTK will examine prognostic properties of the biomarkers identified to drive therapy decisions in this trial. Trial accrual will be asymmetric into the different subtrials. It is expected that 75-100 patients will be accrued into this trial per year at about 14 sites in Germany (mainly Deutsches Konsortium für Translationale Krebsforschung, DKTK and Neuroonkologische Arbeitsgemeinschaft, NOA). Importantly, the parallel SPECTAbrain initiative of the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) is synergistic and not competitive to our study proposal since it is focused on the treatment at recurrence, using paraffin-embedded tissues, panels/arrays only and it would be desirable that data from these initiatives are looked at in a joined manner.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03158389,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; pediatric,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

The goal of this study is to determine if MR fingerprinting, new way of acquiring MRI images, can help identify the extent of tumor spread in the brain, better than routine MRI images.","Glioblastomas (GBs) are aggressive malignant brain tumors with a median survival of less than 15 months . Infiltration of cancer beyond the tumor margins causes recurrence in nearly 100% of GBs; however, this cannot be measured by current imaging techniques . Availability of reliable and reproducible infiltration prediction maps at initial diagnosis will open new treatment opportunities such as targeted surgery or escalated radiation therapy (RT).

On clinical contrast enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, a typical GB demonstrates an enhancing mass with central necrosis and an extensive surrounding, peritumoral region with bright signal on T2-weighted(w) and FLAIR (Fluid attenuation inversion recovery) images. This bright, peritumoral T2/FLAIR region is known to contain vasogenic edema and tumor infiltration, as it is well known that GBs infiltrate beyond the enhancing tumor margins.

Since there is a clear link between extent of tumor resection and survival the challenge for neurosurgeons is maximizing resection of tumor, while avoiding neurological injury. Typically, the central region of the tumor can be safely resected with minimal risk. The challenge lies in maximal safe resection along the tumor margins as it infiltrates normal brain. MR Fingerprinting is a quantitative imaging (QI) scan developed at CWRU that provides rapid quantification of multiple tissue properties, such as T1 and T2 relaxation maps, with high reproducibility and excellent tissue characterization.

When neutrons have relatively low energy, boron atoms that have been targeted to cancerous tissue using a suitable boron carrier (an amino acid derivative called BPA, boronophenylalanine) will capture the neutrons. As a result from the neutron capture the boron atoms will split into two, producing helium and lithium ions. The helium and lithium ions, in turn, have only a short pathlength in tissue (about 5 micrometers) and will deposit their cell damaging effect mainly within the tumor provided that the boron carrier (BPA) has accumulated in the tumor. In practice, the study participants will receive BPA as an approximately 2-hour intravenous infusion, following which the tumor is irradiated with low energy (epithermal) neutrons obtained from a nuclear reactor at the BNCT facility. BNCT requires careful radiation dose planning, but neutron irradiation will last approximately only for one hour. In this study BNCT is given once. The study hypothesis is that anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas that have recurred following conventional radiotherapy might accumulate the boron carrier compound, and might respond to BNCT.","This is a single BNCT-facility, non-randomized, non-comparative, prospective, open-label, phase I/II study to determine the value of BNCT in the treatment of inoperable, irradiated, progressing anaplastic astrocytomas or glioblastomas following conventional radiation therapy.

BPA is infused as a fructose complex (BPA-F) into a peripheral vein over 2 hours prior to neutron irradiation. Blood samples will be taken before starting the BPA infusion, and thereafter at 20 to 40 minute intervals during the infusion, following infusion, and after delivering neutron irradiation to monitor the blood boron concentration. The blood samples will be analyzed for boron to estimate the average blood boron level during neutron irradiation.

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is currently a mainstay treatment for GBM; however, the dose delivered is limited by side effects. The targeted radiotherapy of the TheraSphere GBM Y-90 Glass Microsphere System (TheraSphere GBM) has promising potential to provide GBM patients with reduced side effects compared to external beam radiotherapy as well as a more effective treatment for this catastrophic disease.

The TheraSphere GBM device utilized in the FRONTIER trial is an yttrium-90 (Y-90) glass microsphere therapy for selective internal radiation therapy (endovascular radiotherapy) in recurrent GBM patients. The TheraSphere GBM treatment utilizes intra-arterial delivery and takes advantage of blood flow and direct tumor delivery. Treatment can be delivered by specific placement of a catheter close to the tumor through known angiographic techniques currently utilized by neuro-endovascular or interventional radiology physicians. Angiographic evaluation prior to treatment allows identification of tumor feeding arteries and definition of the treatment volume. TheraSphere GBM could achieve a high tumor response rate based on delivery of a tumor absorbed dose that is not currently possible with EBRT.

NCT00397072,Phase II Study: Systemic Treatment With iv ZK219477-Epothilone in Recurrent Glioblastoma Patients,COMPLETED,['PHASE2'],INTERVENTIONAL,15,ACTUAL,"Amerigo Boairdi, MD (Istituto Nazionale Neurologico Carlo Besta)",2006-06,2008-12,2008-03,Fondazione I.R.C.C.S. Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta,,Glioblastoma,ZK 219477,18 years,70 years,ALL,"The purpose of this single arm phase II study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of ZK 219477 in the treatment of temozolomide pre-treated, recurrent GBM patients.","Malignant gliomas remain among the most devastating cancers, and especially for recurrent GBM no standard treatment has been established to date.

ZK 219477 is a fully synthetic analogue of Epothilone B, a naturally occurring cytotoxic substance. ZK 219477 inhibits microtubule depolymerization, causing cell cycle blockage in G2/M phase and induction to apoptosis. This mechanism of action is similar to that of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel), but epothilones retain activity against multi-drug resistance (MDR) tumours. ZK 219477 demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo considerable anti-tumour activity against a wide range of malignancies, and it is now about to enter phase II studies in a number of selected indications. In pre-clinical model ZK 219477 has demonstrated anti-tumorigenic activity for gliomas tumours both in vitro and in vivo.

ZK 219477 has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, a fundamental characteristic for a potential GBM chemotherapy. In a preclinical PK study, similar concentrations of ZK 219477 were detected in plasma (1.2 μg/ml) and brain (0.9 μg/g) after 10 min after i.v. application in scid mice. The AUC brain/AUC plasma was about 0.8, indicating a free access to the brain (Hoffmann J et al. 2004, European Journal Cancer Supplement 2, N 8, p. 159, Abstract 521, ref.17). ZK 219477 produced strong antiproliferative activity in the human glioma cell line U373 inoculated subcutaneous in nude mice (2 mg/kg and 9 mg/kg) as well as paclitaxel (8 mg/kg), but on the contrary of paclitaxel, only ZK 219477 demonstrated antitumour activity against U373 implanted in nude mice (9 mg/kg): 8 complete response out 9 treated mice.

Of interest for GBM indication, ZK 219477 is not metabolized by liver cytochrome P450, which is induced by phenytoin and other anti-convulsion drug, commonly used in post-surgery GBM patients.

The purpose of this single arm phase II study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of ZK 219477 in the treatment of pre-treated, recurrent GBM patients. Aim of the study: The purpose of this single arm phase II study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of ZK 219477 in the treatment of pre-treated, recurrent GBM patients. An optional PK study will be performed in selected patients.

Study Design: Open, monocentric, not randomised, single arm, phase II study. Study medication: ZK 219477 epothilone B analog. Study Population: 15 recurrent glioblastoma patients previously treated by surgery, conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ. The 15 patients for this study, represent the first stage of recruitment according to the statistical design.

* Active infection
* Breast-feeding
* Subjects who have received an experimental drug or have participated in a clinical trial within 3 months prior to screening
* Employees of the investigator or study centre with direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that investigator or study centre

Treatments:

Treatment will be administered on an inpatient basis. ZK 219477 will be administered as an i.v. infusion of 3 hours duration at a dose of 16 mg/m2 BSA every three weeks.

Two dose reductions are allowed in order to manage toxicities: 12 mg/m2 and 9 mg/m2.

Evaluation criteria:

Efficacy evaluation. Primary end-point: Progression Free Survival at 6 months (PFS-6). Secondary end-points: Response rates (CR +PR), Median Survival Time (MST). Safety evaluation. Treatment toxicity will be assessed using CTCAE, Version 3.0, except for neurological toxicity that will be assessed also by means of the Scottish Gynaecological Cancer Trials Group (SGCTG) Neurotoxicity Score and electromyography.

Statistics:

A group-sequential design will be used with the chance of remaining alive and free of progression at 6 months, called ""response"", as primary endpoint. The null hypothesis of a response rate ≤ 10% will be tested based on the binomial distribution of the response endpoint at a nominal significance level of 0.10 (one-sided). If the observed response rate in the 15 patients is \< 20%, the null hypothesis will be accepted and study failure will be concluded. If the observed response rate is ≥ 20% (i.e., at least three out of the 15 patients show a response after 6 months), then consideration would be given to studying further. If the observed response rate amounts to at least 5 out of the initial 15 patients, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the study may be stopped after the first stage. Secondary end-points: PFS and MST will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Response, age, KPS, number of surgical procedures performed, previous low grade, and time between end of radiotherapy and start of chemotherapy will be considered variables possibly related to TTP and the time interval between start of chemotherapy and death from any cause (MST).

The safety of combining G207 with a single low dose of radiation, designed to enhance virus replication, tumor cell killing, and an anti-tumor immune response, will also be tested.

Funding Source- FDA OOPD","Outcomes for children with recurrent or progressive cerebellar malignant brain tumors are very poor, and there are a lack of effective salvage therapies once a patient fails standard treatments. G207 is an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV) that has been successfully engineered to introduce mutations in the virus that enable it to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells, but not normal cells. Replication of G207 in the tumor not only kills the infected tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus engenders an anti-tumor immune response; the virus is immunogenic and produces a debris field which exposes cancer cell antigens to immune cells which can target other cancer cells. Thus, the oncolytic effect of the virus and the immune response that the virus stimulates provide a ""one-two punch"" at attacking cancer cells. In preclinical studies, a single 5 Gy dose of radiation within 24 hours of virus inoculation to the tumor increased virus replication and tumor cell killing.

The safety of G207 has been demonstrated in 3 phase I clinical trials involving adults with supratentorial high-grade gliomas adults at the University of Alabama (UAB) and in an ongoing (closed to accrual) phase I clinical trial involving children with recurrent supratentorial brain tumors at Children's of Alabama. In the adult trials, high doses (up to 3 x 10\^9 plaque-forming units) of virus were safely injected directly into the tumor or surrounding brain tissue without serious toxicities. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence of anti-tumor responses have been seen. Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that a variety of aggressive pediatric brain tumor types are sensitive to G207.

This study is a phase I, open-label, single institution clinical trial of G207 alone or combined with a single low dose of radiation in children and young adults, ages 3 to 21 years, with recurrent or progressive cerebellar brain tumors. The primary goal is to determine safety. The secondary aims are to obtain preliminary information on the effectiveness of and immune response to G207. A traditional 3 + 3 design will be used with four patient cohorts. The first cohort will receive G207 alone, and the next cohorts will receive G207 at one of three doses followed by a 5 Gy dose of radiation to active areas of tumor.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03911388,pediatric,Mixed,Unclear,Unclear

Median survival for patients with recurrent disease is approximately 6 months for glioblastoma multiforme. Bevacizumab is used for treatment of recurrent disease; however patients who fail bevacizumab do not have many treatment options.

Metastases to the brain are the most common intracranial tumors in adults and occur ten times more frequently than primary brain tumors. It is estimated that 8 - 10% of cancer patients may develop symptomatic metastatic tumors in the brain. Systemic therapy is rarely used for primary treatment of brain metastases because many tumors that metastasize to the brain are not chemosensitive or have been already heavily pretreated with potentially effective agents, and poor penetration through the blood brain barrier is an additional concern.

Dianhydrogalactitol (DAG) rapidly penetrates both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in brain tissue. Clinical study of DAG in patients with GBM or with progressive secondary brain tumors is warranted. Patients with secondary brain metastases were allowed to enroll into the current protocol in Cohorts 2 and 3; however, enrollment ceased with Amendment 5 and will not be continued beyond Cohort 3.

We will determine the highest dose of ZD6474 (Vandetanib) that can be given safely when combined with temozolomide (Temodar) and radiation therapy.

Phase II:

The purpose of this research study is to determine the efficacy of the combination treatment of ZD6474 (Vandetanib) with the standard therapy for glioblastomas and gliosarcomas, temozolomide (Temodar) and radiation therapy. This agent is investigational for the treatment of glioblastomas.

All subjects participating in this research study must NOT be taking a certain type of anti-seizure medication called enzyme inducing anticonvulsant drugs. These drugs include (but are not limited to) the following medications: Dilantin, Tegretol, Phenobarbital and trileptal.","Currently the standard treatment for glioblastomas and gliosarcomas is temozolomide (Temodar) and radiation therapy. This study is being done because research has shown that glioblastomas have genetic changes that may cause an excess of certain cell growth factors and their receptors, which can cause uncontrolled tumor growth. The drug being used in this research study, ZD6474 (Vandetanib), is designed to block the receptors to two of these growth factors, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the epidermal growth factor (EGF). These growth factors are important in pathways that promote tumor growth and increasing blood supply to the tumor. Blocking these receptors may reduce the blood supply to the tumor and help slow down tumor growth. There is also laboratory evidence that blocking these receptors may increase the sensitivity of glioblastomas to radiation therapy.

This research study is a Phase I/II clinical trial.

Phase I clinical trials test the safety of an investigational drug. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. We will determine the highest dose of ZD6474 (Vandetanib) that can be given safely when combined with temozolomide (Temodar) and radiation therapy.

The purpose of Phase II of this research study is to determine the efficacy of the combination treatment of ZD6474 (Vandetanib) with the standard therapy for glioblastomas and gliosarcomas, temozolomide (Temodar) and radiation therapy. It will look to see how patients fare on treatment (if they progress and when, how they are doing after 12 months of treatment). In this research study, the safety of the combination treatment of ZD6474 (Vandetanib) with the standard therapy for glioblastomas and gliosarcomas, temozolomide (Temodar) and radiation therapy will be further evaluated. We will also be looking at samples to see if there are correlations between them and how well patients do on treatment.

This agent is investigational for the treatment of glioblastomas. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it.

Bevacizumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with recurrent glioblastoma . It works by targeting a specific protein called VEGF, which plays a role in promoting the growth or spreading of tumor blood vessels. Since anti-VEGF agents also affect normal blood vessels in the brain, they can inhibit the way other drugs used in combination with bevacizumab are delivered to the tumor.

In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells. For the PET scans in this research study, the investigators are using an investigational radioactive substance called FMISO. ""Investigational"" means that the role of FMISO-PET scans is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. FMISO goes to areas with low oxygenation so parts of the tumor that do not have enough oxygen can be seen.

In addition, a vascular MRI will be used to evaluate the changes in tumor blood flow, blood volume, and how receptive blood vessels are. This scan will be performed at the same time of the FMISO-PET scan.","This study does not add any additional treatment to patients with malignant glioma who are already scheduled to receive bevacizumab monotherapy. All treatment decisions will be at the discretion of the treating physician. There will be no change in the diagnosis or management of the patient based on any procedures or tests carried out as a part of this study.

If the participant chooses to take part in this research study each treatment cycle will last 28 days.

* Day 1-The participant will have the following procedures done before they can receive bevacizumab:

  * An assessment of the participant's tumor by Vascular MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and FMISO-PET scans
  * Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.
* Day 14:The participant will have the following procedures done after they receive bevacizumab:

  * An assessment of the participant's tumor by Vascular MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and FMISO-PET scans before the participant have received bevacizumab
  * Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.
* Day 28: The participant will have the following procedures done after they receive bevacizumab:

  * An assessment of the participant's tumor by Vascular MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and FMISO-PET scans after the participant has received bevacizumab
  * Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

FMISO-PET Scans:

* The participant will have the scans performed in Charlestown, MA at the Martinos Center. The participant will be injected with two separate intravenous (IV) injections (listed below). Intravenous means a need will be injected into a vein in the participant's arm.

  * FMISO for PET scan and a contrast dye for the MRI scan
  * Drawing blood to assess the radioactivity of FMISO
* The PET scan will take approximately 60-75 minutes. The participant will receive one injection of FMISO. Following the injection of the radiotracer, blood samples will be taken from the second IV line. The tracer is given through a vein (IV) and travels through the participant's blood and collects in organs and tissues. The participant will need to wait nearby as the tracer is absorbed by the their body. This takes about 90 minutes. Then, the participant will lie on a narrow table that slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET will pick up signals from the tracer and a computer will change the signals into 3D pictures that will be displayed on a monitor for the participant's study doctor to read.

MRI Scan:

* MRI scans will last about 60-75 minutes. This will occur at the same time as the PET scan. The participant will be injected with contrast dye twice during the MRI scan. The participant will have 3 MRI scans (prior to starting treatment, day 1 of treatment and day 14 of treatment) that would not have routinely been performed if the participant were not participating in this study.
* Blood samples will be collected during both scans in order to measure how the participant blood vessels are processing the radiotracer FMISO and how well it is being delivered to the tumor tissue.
* The participant will be assessed for side effects via clinic visit or phone call about 24 hours after each of the visits above.

Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to call the participant every 3 months for three years after the 28 day visit to see how they are doing and if the participant is experiencing any side effects.

The investigational drug, Methimazole is not FDA approved for brain tumors, but it is used to treat thyroid illnesses. Different doses of Methimazole will be given to several study participants with glioblastoma. The first several study participants will receive the lowest dose.

Additionally, endogenous H2S production and signaling via protein sulfhydration are decreased in human glioblastoma brain tissues compared to non-cancerous brain tissue. Thus, boosting H2S levels is a promising and novel therapeutic strategy for treating glioblastoma. The use of exogenous H2S is difficult to translate to the clinic due to toxicity and volatility. Therefore, bolstering endogenous H2S synthesis and signaling represents a safe and promising method to mitigate disease progression. Based on previously published data, which detailed the use of the thyroid hormone inhibitor propylthiouracil (PTU) to enhance endogenous H2S production in mice, and a previous clinical trial at CCF utilizing PTU to increase the survival of glioblastoma patients, revisiting the use of thyroid hormone inhibitors to de-repress endogenous H2S production concurrent with standards of care poses a novel therapeutic avenue. In the nearly two decades since the aforementioned clinical trial, PTU has been largely replaced in clinical endocrinology by the safer and more efficient thyroid inhibitor methimazole. Given our recent success elucidating the importance of tumor suppressive H2S in the realm of GBM, it is hypothesized that reduced thyroid hormone production via oral methimazole intake will bolster the effectiveness of frontline therapy and extend survival by boosting H2S production and function within the tumor-bearing brain. The goal of this trial is to provide proof of the concept that suppression of thyroid hormone signaling via methimazole and subsequent augmentation of H2S synthesis and signaling is feasible in patients with glioblastoma.

Subjects may continue to receive subsequent cycles of EGFR(V)-EDV-Dox unless the subject becomes intolerant to investigational product (IP), withdraw consent or the individual is no longer receiving clinical benefit (factors taken in to consideration will be disease progression radiologically or clinically, and clinical benefits to quality of life). Tumour assessment will be repeated after each 7 week cycle (week 8).

The study will take place in two parts, Part 1 (Dose Exploration) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion).

Part 1 - Dose Exploration will assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of drug at two dose levels (5 x 10\^9 and 8 x 10\^9) and will enroll prior to Part 2. Three subjects will be recruited per dose level. Enrollment will begin with the 5 x 10\^9 dose level, and the decision to enroll to the 8 x 10\^9 dose level will follow a comprehensive safety evaluation and a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation study design.

Part 2 - Dose Expansion will be conducted pending safety results of Part 1 to provide guidance regarding the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Subjects will be treated and assessed as outlined in Part 1 above. If 0 out of 3 subjects, or 1 out of 6 subjects, experience dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at the 5 x 10\^9 dose level in Part 1, additional subjects to a total of 10 will be recruited to this dose level in Part 2. Similarly, if 0 out of 3 subjects, or 1 out of 6 subjects, experience DLTs at the 8 x 10\^9 dose level in Part 1, additional subjects to a total of 10 will be recruited to this dose level in Part 2. If both dose levels are tolerated, a total of 10 subjects per dose level will be enrolled.

A safety follow-up visit must be performed 30 (+5) days after the last dose of drug for all subjects.All subjects who discontinue investigational product and who have not withdrawn full consent to participate in the study will continue in the long term follow-up phase. Long term follow-up will continue approximately every 1 month for 12 months, from the 30 (+5) day follow-up visit, then approximately every 2-3 months for the extent of subject survival.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02766699,,Adult,Unclear,Unclear
NCT04223999,Enhancing Tumor Treating Fields for Recurrent Glioblastoma With Targeted and Individualised Skullremodeling Surgery: A Multi-center Randomized Phase 2 Trial,RECRUITING,['PHASE2'],INTERVENTIONAL,70,ESTIMATED,"Anders R Korshøj, MD, PhD (Aarhus University Hospital); Anders Rosendal Korshøj, MD PhD",10/1/2020,3/1/2026,3/1/2024,Anders Rosendal Korshøj,"NovoCure GmbH; Odense University Hospital; Aalborg University Hospital; Rigshospitalet, Denmark",Recurrent Glioblastoma,Skullremodeling surgery; Control,18 years,,ALL,"The aim of this trial is to test a new potential treatment, skullremodeling surgery (SR-surgery) combined with tumor treating fields (TTFields), for patients with first recurrence of malignant brain tumor (first recurrence of glioblastoma). Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant cancers.

TTFields is a new treatment for brain cancer (glioblastoma), which is used in additional to surgery (removal of the tumor), chemotherapy and radiation. TTFields work by sending alternating current to the tumor. The current disrupts cell division and thus prevents cancer growths. Electrodes are placed on the scalp and the current is delivered via a small portable battery (1kg). Treatment duration is 18 hours during the day, where the patient can do normal daily activities. The average life expectancy of a newly diagnosed brain cancer patient (glioblastoma) is increased from 15 months to 21 months by adding TTFields.

SR-surgery is a minor and safe procedure, that involves creating small burrholes in the skull over the tumor location. The burrholes are approximately 15 mm in diameter. The burrholes increase the electric current in the tumor by funneling the electricity trough the path of least resistance, since bone hinders the electricity.

The theory is that combining TTFields with SR-surgery we can increase the effect of TTFields and in return increase overall survival for brain cancer patients.

The investigators have recently finished a phase 1 clinical trial, with 15 trial participants, testing the safety and efficacy of our combined treatment. The investigators concluded that TTFields and SR-surgery combined is safe and showed promising results by increasing overall survival with the trial participants.

Therefor we wish to proceed with a phase 2 trial.

Method The investigators aim to include 70 patients with first recurrence of glioblastoma (brain cancer). Each patient will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. Both treatment arms will receive the best current brain tumor treatment. In addition, one arm receives TTF and the other arm TTFields and SR-surgery.

All patients are expected to receive better treatment than current best practice, since TTFields is not standard treatment in Denmark.

The primary aim of the trial is to assess the 12-month overall survival in both groups. The theory is that more trial participants will be alive after 12 months in the group that receives both TTF and SR-surgery.

The trial duration is 36 months with an average expected follow-up of 18 months.","Introduction Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low-intensity (1-3 v/m) intermediate frequency (200 khz for GBM) alternating fields that disrupt cell division. The treatment is increasingly used as a supplementary modality for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Recent randomized clinical studies have demonstrated tolerability of TTFields (Optune®, Novocure®) for both newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM and a significant and sustained survival benefit in the former population. Specifically, the addition of TTFields to maintenance temozolomide (TMZ) therapy for newly diagnosed GBM patients, who had completed initial concurrent radio-chemotherapy, resulted in significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (PFS = 6.7 vs. 4.0 months, p\<0.001) and median overall survival (OS = 20.9 vs. 16.0 months, p\<0.001) compared to maintenance TMZ therapy alone (ef-14 trial) (4). Consequently, TTFields were recently approved by the US FDA and included as a category 1 recommendation in the most recent guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. For recurrent GBM, TTFields monotherapy has been shown to have equivalent efficacy and a superior toxicity profile compared to best practice medical oncological therapy. This led to US FDA approval for this indication in 2011. In addition, a post-hoc analysis of the EF-14 dataset has indicated that the addition of TTFields to 2nd line medical oncological treatment at first disease recurrence leads to an overall survival benefit. Finally, the pride dataset showed that the addition of TTFields to current practice of medical oncological treatment was beneficial.

Recently, the investigators proposed a novel approach to calculate the electrical field distribution induced by TTFields therapy of GBM. The approach utilizes finite element analysis and incorporates personalized MRI data to provide a realistic and individualized estimate of the field intensity distribution, which is associated with the antimitotic efficacy of the treatment. Using this approach, the investigators showed that targeted skull-remodeling surgery, e.g. craniectomy or multiple burr-holes, can provide a substantial and highly focused enhancement (\~100%) of the median field intensity in supratentorial tumors, while leaving the field distribution in healthy tissues unaffected.

These results support the theoretical rationale that small and clinically feasible craniectomies may improve the clinical efficacy of TTFields for cerebral hemispheric tumors without compromising patient safety. Based on these findings, the investigators recently concluded an open-label, single arm, prospective phase 1 trial (NCT02893137) to investigate safety and feasibility of SR-surgery with TTFields and best practice neuro-oncological therapy for recurrent GBM. The trial was active from December 2016 to May 2019. The planned total number of patients was fifteen. Eligibility criteria included age \> 18 years, first recurrence focal supratentorial GBM (RANO), and KPS ≥ 70. Patients were right-censored for OS and PFS at the time of analysis and excluded upon progression, death, SUSARs, or unacceptable AEs. The primary endpoint was toxicity (CTCAEv4.0). The secondary endpoints were OS, PFS, PFS rate at six months (PFS6), objective response rate (ORR) based on the iRANO criteria (14), quality of life (QoL), Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and steroid dose.20 patients were screened, 2 declined, and 3 had KPS \< 70. Of the 15 enrolled patients, 4 were excluded prior to TTFields due to radionecrosis/non-recurrence, post-op infection, neurodeficit and withdrawal of consent, respectively. All included patients (11 male and 2 female) had GBM IDH-wt tumors (4 MGMT-methylated). Median KPS was 90 (range 70-100) and median age 57 years (range 39 to 67). All patients received maximum safe resection at recurrence (4 had no residual tumor (RANO), 5 non-measurable disease, and 2 measurable disease). 9 patients received adjuvant bevacizumab monotherapy and 2 temozolomide rechallenge. The mean skull-defect area was 10.6 cm2 (range 7 to 37 cm2) and the median field enhancement 43 % (range 25 to 59%). The median follow-up duration was 10 months and the median TTFields compliance 90% (range 48 to 98%). We observed no SUSARs, no grade 4/5 SAEs, 12 grade 3 SAEs (6 generalized seizures in patients with known epilepsy, 1 post-op infection, 1 diarrhea, 1TIA, 1 fatigue, 1 headache and 1 DVT). The most common grade AE 1-2 was headache 60% CI95%= \[32; 84\], fatigue 53%, CI95%= \[27; 79\], skin rash 47%, CI95%= \[21; 73\], and nausea 40%, CI95%= \[16; 68\].

Regarding survival results were PFS6 was 64%, CI95%= \[35; 85\], PFS= 8.8 months, CI95%= \[6.2; 13.2\], OS= 15.0 months, CI95%= \[9.6;16.2\], and OS12= 64%, CI95%= \[35;85\]. One patient had complete response during TTFields. Based on these results, the investigators concluded that skull-remodelling surgery incl. craniectomy is not associated with additional toxicity in combination with TTFields and best practice medical oncological treatment and holds promising potential for improving TTFields outcome by focally enhancing the field intensity in the tumor. The proposed phase 2 trial aims to validate this hypothesis in a randomized comparative setting.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS Trial design The study is designed as an investigator-initiated, prospective, multi-center, multi-national, randomized, minimax two-stage, comparative, phase 2 trial, investigating superior efficacy of the intervention. Patients randomized to the control arm will receive TTFields plus best physician's choice medical oncological treatment (BPC treatment) and patients in the interventional arm will receive SR-surgery in addition to TTFields and BPC treatment. The trial will enroll an expected sample size of 70 patients from 4-6 scandinavian countries with Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, as the Sponsor and coordinating site. The primary outcome will be overall survival at 12 months (OS12) and the trial is designed to detect a 20% increase in OS12 in the interventional arm compared to control (from 40% in the control arm to 60% in the interventional arm). Secondary outcomes will include progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QoL), clinical performance, and objective response rate (ORR). Interim futility analysis will be conducted after 12 months follow-up of the first 52 patients. The trial will be stopped at interim analysis if the OS12 months is lower in the control arm compared to the interventional arm. The trial design and data reporting is in accordance with the consort 2010 statement, the gnosis standards for neuro-oncology trials, recent RANO recommendations for phase 2 trial design in neuro-oncology, and general recommendations for phase 2/3 trial design (16-19). The study will be performed in the period march 2020 to march 2023. The inclusion period is expected to be the first 24 months of the trial.

Participants Seventy (70) patients with progressive GBM according to RANO criteria will be enrolled. Potential trial participants will be identified at an institutional multidisciplinary neuro-oncological tumor boards and subsequently referred for eligibility screening. All inclusion scans are assessed by a trained neuroradiologist. Patients who are immediately ineligible, e.g. due to poor performance status, multifocal disease, significant comorbidity, evidence of extracranial primary tumor, or other excluding circumstances, will not be referred for screening.

Experimental intervention Patients will be randomised 1:1 to one of two study arms to receive either, 1) SR-surgery, TTFields and best practice medical oncological therapy (interventional arm), or 2) TTFields and best practice medical oncological therapy alone (control arm). Best practice treatment will typically also include maximum safe resection. Since the intervention (SR-surgery) is only effective during TTFields therapy, TTFields will continue until 1) patient exclusion from the trial, 2) occurrence of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) related to the intervention, or 3) ethical or medical safety contraindication for further TTFields therapy determined by the investigators. This means that treatment may continue beyond progression, as long as active treatment is indicated, and in some cases as compassionate use.

Sample size and statistical considerations The sample size calculations were based on a randomized, comparative, minimax two-stage design and the binomial primary outcome of OS12 for the patient population treated per protocol, i.e. for whom TTFields therapy was initiated. This means that patients excluded prior to TTFields therapy initiation are not included in the primary outcome analysis. Therefore, additional patients may be enrolled to ensure that the planned sample receives active TTFields treatment. The aim of the trial is to determine whether the intervention is superior to control and thus worthy of further phase 3 investigation. The expected OS12 in the control arm is set to 40% based on the EORTC 26101 trial, in which patients with first recurrence of GBM were treated with lomustine monotherapy or lomustine/bevacizumab combination therapy. The trial showed an OS12 of approximately 30% and we therefore set the expected level of OS12 to be slightly above this threshold given the fact that TTFields is added to the treatment which otherwise represents recommended practice. There are no current studies providing accurate OS12 estimates for a population comparable to the study control arm and we therefore based the estimate on an expected benefit of 10% from TTFields alone compared to EORTC 26101. Setting the probabilities of false-positive and false-negative trial results to α = 0.15 and 1-β = 0.80, respectively, and defining the expected target level of OS12 to be OS12 = 0.6, i.e. a 20% absolute increase (and 50% relative increase) compared to the control arm, we calculated a maximum sample size of n = 42 patients in each arm (total n = 84) and an expected total sample size (en = 69.8). The expected sample size en is calculated as en = n1 × pet0 + n × (1 - pet0), where n1 = 52 is the collective sample size of both groups at interim (stage 1) analysis, pet0 = 0.44 is the probability of early futility termination. The numbers are based on the given statistical parameters and a two-stage minimax design as given in sh jung 2018. Interim futility analysis will be conducted after endpoint assessment of 52 patients and the trial will be terminated if the experimental arm performs worse than the control arm. In this case the futility criterion will be defined as OS12experimental \< OS12control and this conclusion will determine futility at marginal power and significance levels of 1-β\* = 0.80 and of α\* = 0.20, respectively. If the trial is not terminated at interim stage 1 analysis, the trial will proceed to enroll a total of 84 patients and terminate when the final OS12 endpoint data have been obtained for all patients.

The secondary outcome measures of hazard rate ratios of PFS and OS will be tested using the log-rank test at the 0.05 alpha level. Time-to-event endpoints will be estimated from the time of randomization. Toxicity and adverse events will be reported using absolute numbers and appropriate risk estimates. Final analysis will be conducted when all patients have been excluded or censored, e.g. due to end-of-trial, or loss-to-follow-up. Subgroup analysis based on prognostic factors will be performed, incl. analysis of patient characteristics in each arm and identification of characteristics of potential responders to the intervention. This will also include a correlation analysis between the calculated field distribution and outcome estimates. Analyses will be based on both the intent-to-treat population and the population proceeding to active therapy (per protocol), i.e. At least four weeks of active TTFields therapy with ≥75% average compliance.

Randomisation and blinding Patients will be randomised immediately upon enrollment in the trial, i.e. prior to initial surgery. Randomisation will be performed using randomization.com and patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive TTFields and best practice medical oncological treatment w/o skull remodeling surgery. The study endpoint assessment committee will be blinded to the intervention. Local principal investigators, co-investigators and sub-investigators will not be blinded, as optimal array planning will require knowledge about skull-remodeling surgery. The operating surgeon performing the skull-remodeling surgery will not be blinded. Patients will not be blinded, as it will be possible for the patient to feel the skull configuration and thereby determine whether SR-surgery was performed.

Risks and safety precautions General safety considerations concerning Optune® therapy are outlined in the related technical and safety material provided by Novocure®. In general, TTFields therapy is regarded a safe and recognized treatment for GBM. The most common adverse effect is local skin rash in the area underlying the transducer arrays. The risk of skin rash will be reduced by slightly moving the arrays during regular array changes. Skin rash may be treated with topical corticosteroids, more frequent electrode replacement and short pauses in TTFields therapy, if needed. The risk of brain injury due to the skull remodeling aspect of surgery is minimal, as the entire operation is performed extra-durally. Minor craniectomies do not pose a significant risk of mechanical brain injury. For larger craniectomies, external protective headgear, such as a cap with mechanical reinforcement over the unprotected brain area, may be used to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury after craniectomy. In the case of post-operative infection or impaired wound healing, antibiotic therapy will be administered. If needed, surgical revision/debridement of the wound and potentially removal of the bone flap may be performed. In such cases, the patient may proceed to receive or continue TTFields therapy at an appropriate time, if it is in the patient's best interest. TTFields therapy following removal of the infected bone flap may be accepted even if the craniectomy size exceeds 30 cm2. In all cases, the decision whether to continue with TTFields therapy after surgery will be based on careful consideration of the expected safety and benefit for the patient. All participants will be advised of situations and adverse events, in which medical attention is required. Investigators or properly trained medical personnel will be available for immediate attention or medical advice specific to the treatment or protocol. Patients will receive contact information to the device support specialist, whom they may contact in case of technical problems or considerations.

Monitoring and quality control The project will comply with international guidelines good clinical practice (ICH-GCP and ds/en iso 14155:2012. Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects - good clinical practice) and be monitored by the local contract research organization (CRO). Source data, verification of consent, and handling of adverse events and near-miss incidents will be subject to 20% sampled monitoring. Full access to all source data, incl. patient records, will be granted in relation to trial inspection by the relevant national competent authorities. Experimental ""waivers"" from the protocol will be registered in the project trial master file and reported to the relevant authorities. Changes to the protocol will be submitted for approval by the relevant authorities in accordance with GCP guidelines and regulations.

* Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests, and tumor imaging studies.
* Participants will be separated into two treatment groups: one group that will receive surgery to remove the glioma and one that will not have surgical treatment.
* Participants in the nonsurgical treatment group will take AZD8055 by mouth daily for a 42-day cycle of treatment. Participants will keep a diary to record doses and keep track of any side effects.
* Participants in the surgical treatment group will take AZD8055 by mouth daily for 7 days, and then will have tumor removal surgery. At least 3 weeks after surgery, participants will resume doses of AZD8055 and will continue to take the drug for as long as the tumor does not recur.
* During treatment, participants will have regular visits to the clinical center, involving frequent blood and urine tests and other examinations to monitor the effects of treatment. Participants will have imaging studies to study the cancer's response to the treatment.
* Participants will continue to have cycles of treatment for as long as the treatment continues to be effective and the side effects are not severe enough to stop participation in the study....","Background:

* Recurrent glioma patients have very limited treatment options. A significant percentage of gliomas have increased activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, mostly due to loss of PTEN.
* AZD8055 is a first in-class inhibitor of the kinase activity of mTOR, specifically inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Preclinical data generated in the Neuro-Oncology Branch Laboratory of Dr. Howard Fine demonstrated that AZD8055 has significant anti-glioma activity in vivo and in vitro.

Objectives:

* To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous once daily AZD8055 in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED).
* To generate pharmacokinetic data on continuous once daily AZD8055 dosing.

Eligibility:

-Patients with histologically proven glioma are eligible for this study. Patients should have failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy.

Design:

* This study will accrue up to 24 evaluable patients (non-surgical arm). Cohorts of 3 or 6 patients will receive continuous AZD8055 once daily orally for 42 days. The MTD will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 6 weeks of treatment only. Up to three patients may be enrolled simultaneously at each dose level. The dose of AZD8055 can be progressively escalated if only 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity at the prior dose level.
* A subset of patients in whom tumor re-resection is considered standard of care will receive 1-week treatment with AZD8055 and then undergo resection. Patients will be treated at the highest dose level shown to be safe at the time of enrollment. Once patients recover from surgery, they will restart treatment with AZD8055 and stay on treatment as long as there is no tumor progression or protocol-mandated removal criteria. Management of toxicity will be the same as non-surgical patients receiving their second and subsequent cycles of therapy as delineated in the protocol. Up to 12 patients will enter the surgical arm of this trial.
* The accrual ceiling will be open to 42 patients to factor in replacing those who come off

treatment prior to cycle 1.

-At the end of Cycle 1, patients in both treatment arms (surgical and non-surgical) may choose to continue to receive AZD8055 until disease progression or until they experience unmanageable drug related toxicity, as long as they are continuing to derive clinical benefit and do not fulfill any of the criteria for removal from protocol therapy.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01316809,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

Radiation is delivered up to a total dose of 60 Gy using photons. Using this treatment regimen, overall survival could be extended significantly however, median overall survival is still only about 15 months.

Carbon ions offer physical and biological advantages. Due to their inverted dose profile and the high local dose deposition within the Bragg peak precise dose application and sparing of normal tissue is possible. Moreover, in comparison to photons, carbon ions offer an increase relative biological effectiveness (RBE), which can be calculated between 2 and 5 depending on the GBM cell line as well as the endpoint analyzed. Protons, however, offer an RBE which is comparable to photons.

First Japanese Data on the evaluation of carbon ion radiation therapy showed promising results in a small and heterogeneous patient collective.

In the current Phase II-CLEOPATRA-Study a carbon ion boost will be compared to a proton boost applied to the macroscopic tumor after surgery at primary diagnosis in patients with GBM applied after standard radiochemotherapy with TMZ up to 50 Gy. In the experimental arm, a carbon ion boost will be applied to the macroscopic tumor up to a total dose of 18 Gy E in 6 fractions at a single dose of 3 Gy E.

The purpose of the trial is to compare a carbon ion boost to a proton boost delivered to the macroscopic tumor in combination with combined radiochemotherapy with TMZ in patients with primary GBM.

The aim of the study is to compare overall survival as a primary endpoint, and progression free survival, toxicity and safety as secondary endpoints.

Focus of the analysis is to evaluate the change in overall survival and local control by carbon ion radiotherapy. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to evaluate the improvement in outcome due to effect of the altered biology of carbon ions on GBM.

It is based on the results of ongoing studies at our Institute to validate the efficacy of extremely hypofractionated RT in neoadjuvant settings, which observed immunostimulatory effects of RT and the synergy with immune components. The collaboration between San Raffaele Hospital (Milan), the IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori Fondazione G. Pascale (Naples) and the San Giuseppe Moscati Hospital of National Relief and High Specialty (Avellino) will ensure that patient recruitment, treatment and monitoring can be translated into facilities of the National Health System using common procedures. The various departments involved will treat patients with the same methods synergistically exploring the immuno/biological factors related to efficacy (and/or toxicity), based on new radioimmunotherapeutic approaches. Clinical and research activity will be developed jointly, drawing on the expertise in radiotherapy, radiomics, oncology, imaging and immunotherapy skills already available.","This is a prospective multicenter pilot study. Functional and spectroscopic neuroradiological imaging will be adopted for treatment planning. Specialized software will be used to perform radiomic feature extraction and analysis of pre-trained neural networks from the advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT (computed tomography) used for simulation, to identify distribution patterns of aggressive and radioresistant disease areas, with higher probability of disease recurrence, and to intensify the dose on the areas identified as more aggressive, in order to counteract intrinsic radioresistance. The hypofractionated radiotherapy paradigm claims the benefit of reduced treatment times, improved quality of life, better access to specialized treatment centers and potentially improved tumor outcomes with greater disease control and less tumor repopulation. The rationale for neoadjuvant RT is based on the idea of counteracting the tumor's aggressive mechanisms with radiotherapy before the disease is surgically removed, in order to maximize the immunostimulatory potential of RT, and therefore reduce recurrences. Neoadjuvant treatment offers numerous advantages, first of all the ability to adjust the dose to the pathological volume identified by MRI and limit the volume of irradiated healthy brain tissue. Furthermore, the use of imaging derived from functional neuroradiological and spectroscopic techniques for treatment planning would allow us to increase the dose on the areas identified as more aggressive, in order act against intrinsic radioresistance. One of the major risks could be the possibility of developing radionecrosis, but this would not be a cause for concern in the neoadjuvant setting, as all irradiated tissue will then be surgically removed. Patients who agree to participate in the study and who would be candidates for radical surgical treatment, according to the evaluation of the Neurosurgery Department of our Institute, will be treated. These patients will receive neoadjuvant radiation treatment in 5 fractions delivering 30 Gy on PTV and 35-50 Gy on GTV, with a dose-escalation modality that involves increasing the dose to 35-40-42.5-45-47.5-50 Gy in groups of 5 consecutive patients, using standard chemotherapy (TMZ) after surgery.

Current diagnostic brain MRI allows a good definition of the initial disease and its most aggressive areas. Since relapses have always been found to occur in irradiated areas and recent studies have shown that reducing margins does not affect overall survival, smaller margins will be used from GTV to CTV and from CTV to PTV. Therefore, smaller volumes will be generated and treated with hypofractionation. Biological equivalent doses (BED) to the standard prescription will be delivered, with boost to a higher biological equivalent dose, in the most aggressive areas, in order to obtain better local control, maintaining an acceptable level of toxicity and therefore improve the evolution of the disease. CE marked devices (software) will be used according to the approved use, for the definition of the target (CT and MRI) and for the delivery of the treatment (linear accelerators) and the standard drug, which has the authorization for marketing, will be prescribed. Radiomic features related to local response and survival will be identified, to obtain a predictive model. At the same time, we will collect PMBC and patient serum in the biobank to identify presumed immunocorrelated of therapy efficacy and/or predictive biomarkers of response/toxicity to therapy. For comparative purposes, serum from healthy volunteers will also be collected, in numbers equivalent to patients and with sex and age characteristics comparable to the latter.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06551909,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

A dose per fraction escalation study means that successive groups of patients will receive higher doses per fraction of radiation while keeping the total dose of radiation the same (60 Gy, Gy is a radiation unit). The radiation dose per fraction will be increased and the numbers of radiation treatments will be decreased until a fraction dose is reached at which there are unacceptable side effects compared with possible benefit.

In addition, regulatory T cells are depleted by a short cycle of metronomic cyclophosphamide upfront of the vaccine in order to facilitate induction of immune responses.

Therapeutic DC vaccines are followed by four cycles of Nivo/Ipi double checkpoint blockade and a Nivolumab monotherapy maintenance in order to optimize the induced T-cell response.","Relapsed high-grade gliomas (in the following addressed as high-grade gliomas = HGG) in children and adolescents represent a very bad prognosis group for which a recommended standard salvage therapy is currently not available.

Combination of Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccination, metronomic cyclophosphamide, and checkpoint blockade will be investigated in the present trial as a new treatment strategy for these patients: metronomic cyclophosphamide has been shown to significantly reduce numbers of regulatory T cells (Treg) without inducing general leukopenia. DCs might induce tumour-directed immune responses thereby facilitating long-term remissions. Efficacy of primed T-cell responses by the vaccine will potentially be enhanced by the application of checkpoint inhibitors Nivolumab (antiPD-L1) and Ipilimumab (antiCTLA4) in the post-vaccine phase and during maintenance.

Cyclophosphamide is an established drug used as an anti-cancer or immunosuppressive substance since decades, with extensive experience when used in low, non-myeloablative dosages. DCs represent an innovative new strategy in cellular immunotherapy. DCs in cancer patients have been used in a number of smaller studies, and in some of these trials, promising results could be obtained. Several studies showed a trend towards a prolonged overall survival with a few long-term survivors which is otherwise extremely rare in this high-risk population. Results seemed to be more favourable in pediatric than in adult patients. Checkpoint inhibitors (antiPD-L1 and/or antiCTLA4) have been shown to exhibit synergistic effects with vaccines in preclinical models, and prelimnary data of several early stage trials have shown promising results. Therefore, our study aims to improve the efficacy of a DC-based therapeutic vaccine by optimizing the conditions upfront of the vaccine (Treg depletion) and improving T-cell responses by checkpoint blockade after the vaccine in the effector phase.

In conclusion, this study will exploit the optimal efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine in children and adolescents with relapsed HGG.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03879512,immunotherapy; pediatric,Mixed,Unclear,Unclear

Prognosis for patients with high-grade gliomas remains poor. The estimated median survival for patients with GBM is between 12 to 18 months. Recurrence after initial therapy with temozolomide and radiation is nearly universal. Since May 2009, the majority of patients in the US with an initial recurrence of high-grade glioma receive bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is thought to prevent angiogenesis in these highly vascular tumors. BEV has response rates from 32-62% and has improved overall median survival in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas1. However, the response is short lived, and nearly 100% of patients eventually progress despite bevacizumab. No chemotherapeutic agent administered following progression through bevacizumab has made a significant impact on survival. Patients progress to death within 1-5 months after resistance develops. Therefore, patients with high-grade gliomas who have progressed through bevacizumab represent a population in dire need of a feasible and tolerable treatment.

NKTR-102 is a topoisomerase I inhibitor polymer conjugate that was engineered by attaching irinotecan molecules to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer using a biodegradable linker. Irinotecan released from NKTR-102 following administration is further metabolized to the active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38), that causes DNA damage through inhibition of topoisomerase. The goal in designing NKTR-102 was to attenuate or eliminate some of the limiting side effects of irinotecan while improving efficacy by modifying the distribution of the agent within the body. The size and structure of NKTR-102 results in marked alteration in pharmacokinetic (PK) profile for the SN38 derived from NKTR-102 compared to that following irinotecan: the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) is reduced 5- to 10-fold and the half-life (t1/2 ) of SN38 is increased from 2 days to approximately 50 days. This altered profile leads to constant exposure of the tumor to the active drug. In addition, the large NKTR-102 molecule does not freely pass out of intact vasculature, which may account for relatively higher concentrations of the compound and the active metabolites in tumor tissues in in vivo models, where the local vasculature may be relatively more permeable. A 145 mg/m2 dose of NKTR-102, the dose intended for use in this phase II clinical trial (and being used in the phase III clinical program), results in approximately the same plasma exposure to SN38 as a 350 mg/m2 dose of irinotecan, but exposure is protracted, resulting in continuous exposure between dosing cycles and lower Cmax. NKTR-102 was therefore developed as a new chemotherapeutic agent that may improve the clinical outcomes of patients.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01663012,chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have shown a clear synergistic antitumour effect with temozolomide and radiotherapy in preclinical glioma models. THC and CBD have a wide variety of biological effects by binding with and activating the type 1 and type 2 cannabinoid receptors (CB1 expressed in certain neuronal areas of the brain and CB2 expressed in the immune system and in glial cells). The activation of these receptors initiates a signalling pathway, called the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, which generates tumour cell autophagy by activating TRB3.

Given these data, the Spanish Group for Neuro-oncology (GEINO) proposes developing a phase Ib, open-label, multicenter, intrapatient dose-escalation clinical trial to assess the safety profile of the THC+CBD combination at a 1:1 ratio, adding temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma.

The pilot part of this study is to evaluate the use of \[11C\] temozolomide PET (TMZ-PET) scans and MRI scans to tell investigators more about how standard treatment with bevacizumab affects the blood vessels in the participant's tumor, and how these changes affect the way the participant's tumor absorbs temozolomide. ""Investigational"" means that the role of TMZ-PET scans is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it.

Bevacizumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in people with the participant's type of cancer. It works by blocking signals on a specific protein called vascular endothelial growth hormone (VEGF), which plays a role in promoting the growth of spread of tumor blood vessels. Bevacizumab is an ""anti-VEGF' agent because it is designed to slow the growth of the participant's cancer.

Since anti-VEGF agents also affect normal blood vessels in the brain, they can inhibit the way other drugs used in combination with bevacizumab are delivered to the tumor. Researchers are looking for how bevacizumab affects delivery of chemotherapy, in this case temozolomide.

In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells.

For the PET scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance called \[11C\] temozolomide, which is chemically identical to the prescription drug TMZ. TMZ is FDA approved as a chemotherapeutic agent in cancer but \[11C\] temozolomide is an investigational agent.

In this research study, participants will receive standard treatment with bevacizumab and oral temozolomide as well as standard MRI scans. In addition, participants will undergo TMZ-PET scans before and after treatment with bevacizumab. The first TMZ-PET scan will occur 7-13 days after starting treatment with oral temozolomide but before beginning treatment with bevacizumab, day 1 after starting treatment with bevacizumab and 1 month after starting bevacizumab. TMZ-PET scans will be given at the same time as a vascular MRI, which will evaluate the changes in tumor blood flow, blood volume, and how receptive blood vessels are while also measuring how much TMZ is in the brain.","Before the research starts (screening): After signing the consent form, the participant will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if they can be in the research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that the participant does not take part in the research study. If the participant has had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated.

* A medical history, which includes questions about the participant's health, current medications, and any allergies.
* Physical Exam including measuring the participant's height, weight, and vital signs
* Performance status, which evaluates how the participant is able to carry on with your usual activities.
* Blood tests.
* Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential
* Urine test.

If these tests show that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study, the participant will begin the study treatment. If the participant does not meet the eligibility criteria, the participant will not be able to participate in this research study.

After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study:

Please note that this study does not add any additional treatment to participants with your type of cancer. There will be no change in your treatment with bevacizumab and daily temozolomide based on the results of any procedures or tests carried out as a part of the study.

Before each set of scans the participant will have the following tests and procedures:

* Routine blood tests to check the participant's overall health
* Creatinine clearance blood test to check for proper kidney function
* Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

* \[11C\] temozolomide for PET scan and a contrast dye for the MRI scan
* Drawing blood to assess the radioactivity of \[11C\] temozolomide \[11C\] temozolomide PET Scans (TMZ PET Scan):
* The PET scan will take approximately 90 minutes. The participant will receive one injection of \[11C\] temozolomide. Following the injection of the radioactive substance, blood samples will be taken from the second IV line.

MRI Scan:

- MRI scans will last about 60-75 minutes. This will occur at the same time as the PET scan. The participant will be injected with contrast dye twice during the MRI scan.

The MR-PET scan(s) will be performed again on Day 1 after initiation of bevacizumab (or Day 15 after initiation of temozolomide) and Day 30 after initiation of bevacizumab (on Day 45 after initiation of temozolomide).

Blood samples will be collected during both scans in order to measure how your blood vessels are processing the radiotracer \[11C\] temozolomide and how well it is being delivered to the tumor tissue. Blood samples will be drawn 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, and 90 minutes after the \[11C\] temozolomide injection.

The participant will be assessed for side effects via clinic visit or phone call about 24 hours after each of the visits above.

- Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to call the participant every 3 months for three years after their second MR-PET scan to see how they are doing and if the participant is experiencing any side effects. If the participant was removed from the study due to an unacceptable side effect, the participant will be followed until it has been resolved.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01987830,imaging; chemotherapy; pediatric,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

We have defined one primary specific aim, for which we expect to obtain definitive results, and two secondary aims, under which we plan to generate preliminary data to support a future, larger project.","The PET radiotracer FET provides a measure of large, neutral amino acid transport. This transport is significantly upregulated in malignant brain tumors. FET rarely gives false positive findings in the setting of inflammation seen after high dose chemotherapy or radiotherapy. FET labels low-grade as well as high-grade gliomas, in contrast to FDG, which almost exclusively labels only high-grade gliomas. FET imaging may prove to be particularly useful in the setting of infiltrative tumor, which is not contrast-enhancing on MRI and therefore not detectable with FDG. Management of glioblastoma patients with stable contrast-enhancing disease on MRI but increased signs of edema is difficult. This is because it is difficult to distinguish simple edema from infiltrative tumor. The former is managed with steroids and the latter is managed with chemotherapy, and anti-angiogenic drugs.

FET may be particularly useful in assessing changes after GBM patients receive anti-vascular agents such as Avastin. Avastin is very commonly used in patients after failure of first-line treatment in GBM. Not only is Avastin costly, but it also can have serious side effects such as internal bleeding and gastric perforation, severe hypertension, poor wound healing, and renal toxicity. It is important to know when a patient is failing Avastin treatment so that the drug can be discontinued. Preliminary data in Europe (see figures below) suggests that FET-PET can accurately distinguish Avastin responders from non-responders.

Inclusion Criteria:

1. GBM patients with changes on MRI suggestive of recurrence who have not yet initiated antiangiogenic therapy.

Gliomas are the most common type, comprising 40-90% of central nervous system tumors in different age groups. The incidence of malignant gliomas is approximately 0.5-2 per 100,000 people annually. Standard treatments include surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, yet overall survival remains low, typically 1-3 years post-diagnosis. The study highlights the pressing need for novel treatment strategies, particularly given the infiltrative nature of gliomas and the potential for targeted therapies using neuropeptides.

The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of local targeted therapy with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP in recurrent glioblastoma.

It is an interventional study without a control group, initiated by the researcher. Patients included are aged 18-80 with recurrent WHO G3-G4 glioma post-first-line treatment, not requiring immediate surgery and meeting specific MRI progression criteria.

Patients will receive a maximum of six cycles of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP, involving pre-treatment assessments, local administration of the agent after ensuring catheter patency, and continuous monitoring. Blood tests and neurological evaluations will be performed regularly.

Outcome will be assessed by measuring overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The study anticipates improvements in both OS and PFS when compared to current treatments, contributing to critical insights into targeted alpha therapy's effectiveness in glioblastoma.

Treatment with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP previously indicated few significant side effects, primarily transient issues like seizures. Patients will be closely monitored throughout the study to identify any adverse effects promptly.

The estimated study duration is three years, with biological material collected for histopathological and genetic analysis during surgical reoperation.

Data will be anonymized to protect patient confidentiality, stored securely, and made available only for the scope of the study.

Led by Prof. Przemysław Kunert, the research team includes multiple co-investigators from neurosurgery and nuclear medicine departments.","1. Background: Brain tumors account for 1.35% of all cancer conditions and cause deaths in 2.2% of cancer patients (Cancer Facts and Figures 2005). The most common type of brain tumors are gliomas. Depending on the age group, they account for 40%-90% of central nervous system tumors. The incidence of malignant gliomas is 0.5-2 per 100,000 people per year. Men are more frequently affected, usually in their 50s and 60s. In the Polish population, approximately 1300 people are diagnosed with gliomas annually, including about 600 cases of malignant gliomas. The standard treatment approach includes surgical treatment, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Despite the currently accepted treatment regimen, survival times-depending on the tumor type-range from 1 to 3 years.

   In a typical course, regardless of the therapy used, the extent of surgery, and other prognostic factors, the progression of the growth process occurs after some time. The use of chemotherapy extends survival time-depending on the tumor type-by several to several dozen weeks. This data indicates the need to seek other forms of treatment. Since brain gliomas are infiltrative in nature, it seems that an effective drug should exhibit the ability to diffuse freely within the tumor and specifically bind to cancer cells. Selected peptides exhibit such properties.

   One of the mechanisms regulating cell (including cancer cell) function involves receptor systems located in the cell membrane. These show high specificity of reaction with specific peptides. The expression of some receptor systems significantly increases in cells of specific tumor types. This property underlies the use of radioisotope-labeled peptides in diagnosis and treatment in oncology. Peptides bind to cancer cells, and ionizing radiation emitted by the attached radioisotope leads to regression of pathological changes. This method is developed only in a few centers worldwide and is currently used, among others, in treating certain types of lymphomas (anti-CD-20 antibody labeled with 90Y or 131I) and neuroendocrine tumors (somatostatin analogs labeled with 90Y, 177Lu).

   The benefit of this method is the ability to treat tumors that exhibit resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Based on own experiences and literature data, it is known that gliomas show increased expression of selected receptor systems. In grade II-IV gliomas, a significant increase in expression for neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors, for which substance P is the ligand, has been noted. When administered directly to the tumor, substance P undergoes rapid diffusion and binding to glioma cells.

   At the center in Basel (Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Basel), a derivative of substance P (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1-glutaric acid-4,7,10-triacetic acid) was developed. It was shown that over 95% of gliomas exhibit significantly increased expression of the NK-1 receptor system, and that the proposed peptide has a capacity for specific binding to this type of receptor (out of 34 glioma tissue samples, 32 samples showed significantly increased NK-1 receptor system expression).

   Substance P can be labeled with various radioisotopes with differing physical properties, including 90Y and 177Lu-beta radiation emitters. The beta radiation emitted by 90Y has an energy of 2.1 MeV, with a tissue range of about 12 mm. Lutetium emits radiation with an energy of 497 keV, with a range of 1 mm. Limiting factors for the use of beta radiation include its range of action. There is a potential risk of damage to functionally critical brain centers if the tumor is located nearby. This was a premise for the use of alpha radiation emitters. One of the studied radioisotopes is 213Bismuth, which has an energy of 5.8 MeV but a range limited to only 81 μm.

   To date, within the framework of the project ""Use of Radioisotope-Labeled Substance P in Treating Patients with Brain Tumors"" (KB/204/A/201), local glioma treatment has been provided using substance P labeled with alpha emitters 213Bi and 225Ac in the case of confirmed disease recurrence.

   Initially, local treatment was performed using \[213Bi\]Bi-DOTA-SP at an activity of up to 11.2 GBq, achieving good treatment tolerance without clinically significant side effects. The progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.7 months, and the median overall survival (OS) after disease recurrence was nearly twice as long as expected in this patient group, amounting to 10.9 months. The median overall survival from diagnosis was 23.6 months. However, after the start of treatment with \[213Bi\]Bi-DOTA-SP, the median survival was 7.5 months.

   Considering the difficulties in labeling and quality control with a short half-life for 213Bi (46 min), the next step involved treatment with the alpha-emitter 225Ac. A study was conducted evaluating the determination of the maximum tolerated dose of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP, administering activities of 10 MBq, 20 MBq, and 30 MBq. The treatment was well tolerated by patients, with predominantly mild and transient adverse effects such as seizures, aphasia, and hemiparesis. Most adverse effects occurred in patients treated with the 30 MBq dose of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP; hence, the maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 20 MBq. Thrombocytopenia of grade 3 was observed in one study participant, and no grade 3 or 4 toxicity related to the treatment with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP was reported in the other participants. The median OS from diagnosis was 35 months, and from recurrence, it was 13.2 months. The PFS from the start of treatment with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP was 2.4 months.

   Studies showed that despite different physical properties (213Bi T1/2 = 46 minutes, 225Ac T1/ 2 = 9.9 days, with 225Ac decaying through alpha particles and 213Bi decaying only once), the survival data for patients treated with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP and \[213Bi\]Bi-DOTA-SP are similar. Theoretically, the significantly longer half-life of 225Ac should allow for better distribution of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP. The diffusion of the administered radiopharmaceutical is a critical factor for effective local therapy and depends on several factors, such as molecular weight, physicochemical properties, varying extracellular space density, and the post-resection cavity. Small vectors, such as modified SP (1800 Da), lead to rapid diffusion within tissues. However, subsequent administrations may increase the density of the extracellular space due to glioma scarring, leading to heterogeneous diffusion in subsequent injections of the radiopharmaceutical. A limiting factor for local treatment is the very slow rate of diffusion into brain tissue. The diffusion rate in the brain for most substances ranges from 0.15 to 0.6 mm/h. One possible cause could be increased tissue pressure within the tumor and surrounding tissues, which reduces the pressure gradient responsible for the diffusion process. It seems that enhanced diffusion could be achieved by employing forced diffusion via a slow infusion of 0.5 ml/hour of saline into the cavity immediately after administering the radiopharmaceutical. Overall results from both treatment arms exhibit a clear trend for prolonged survival compared to standard therapy.

   .
2. Main Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of local targeted therapy with the alpha-emitter labeled neuropeptide \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP (TAT) using a forced diffusion method in cases of recurrence of glioma WHO G3-G4 after first-line treatment.

   Secondary Objective: To assess the safety of local targeted therapy with the alpha-emitter labeled neuropeptide \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP (TAT).

   .
3. Study Design: Interventional study without a control group. The study is initiated by the investigator, and 225Ac is supplied based on a cooperation agreement between WUM and the Institute for Transuranium Elements (Karlsruhe).

   Sponsoring institution: Medical University of Warsaw (WUM). .
4. Conducting the Study:

   1. Qualification visit - gathering a medical history, summarizing previous diagnostics and treatments - necessary documentation from the treatment course and imaging studies (CT scans and/or MRIs) must be provided. During the discussion, the doctor will provide all necessary information regarding the study and answer any questions.
   2. Reoperation with Catheter Placement:

      PET/CT scan using \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA to indicate the site for biopsy and catheter placement.

      Resection with biopsy or just the biopsy of the tumor. Cathether placement (for lesions with a diameter \>2 cm, up to 3 catheters may be placed). Catheter placement will take place at the Departments of Neurosurgery of either University Clinical Centre (UCK) or National Oncology Institute (NIO). This requires several days of hospitalization.
   3. Local Treatment with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP:

      Treatment with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP cannot begin earlier than 2 months after the conclusion of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be continued according to the oncologist's recommendations.

      Catheter patency controle about one week before planned treatment. Local administration of 5 MBq of 68Ga in a volume of 1-3 ml. Imaging of the brain using PET/CT Siemens Vision 600: 30 minutes after the administration of the tracer. For the first 3 patients, dual-day imaging with 68Ga and \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-SP will be performed to assess biodistribution: 5 MBq of 68Ga in a volume of 1-3 ml; 5 MBq of \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-SP in a volume of 1-3 ml.
   4. Conducting the Therapy:

   Patients will be treated with a maximum of 6 cycles of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP. Preparation of the Radiopharmaceutical: The labeling procedure will be carried out at the Nuclear Medicine Department at WUM. The radioisotope 68Ga is available at the Nuclear Medicine Department; the department has a registered 68Ge/68Ga generator. The team of radiopharmacists at the department possess the necessary qualifications and have been performing radiopharmaceutical labeling using 68Ga for many years. 225Ac will be supplied based on a cooperation agreement between WUM and the Institute for Transuranium Elements (Karlsruhe). After labeling, the prepared product will undergo quality control to verify the labeling efficiency and radiopharmaceutical purity. In any case, if the labeling efficiency is below 90%, the product will not be administered to the patient.

   Therapy: Administered activity of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP - 20 MBq in a volume of 10-20% of the resection cavity volume, maximum amount of SP 200 μg (combined for 68Ga and 225Ac).
   * 20-30 minutes before administering \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP, 250 ml of 15% mannitol, 500 ml of 0.9% NaCl, and 8 mg of dexamethasone will be administered intravenously.
   * Immediately after administering the therapeutic dose of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP along with 5-10 MBq of \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-SP, brain imaging will be performed; acquisition time 1-2 minutes.
   * Connection of an infusion pump with saline and administration at a rate of 0.5 ml/hour for 2-4 hours.
   * After the infusion, 2-4 hours after administering \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP, brain imaging will be performed with an acquisition time lasting 4-8 minutes, and a whole-body scan: acquisition time approx. 10 minutes.

   Radioisotope treatment will be carried out in the UCK hospital, during hospitalization at the Department of Neurosurgery. The length of hospitalization will depend on the patient's condition; from previous experiences, this has typically been 3 days.

   Previous experiences have shown good tolerance to treatment with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP. The only noted side effects during therapy were transient facial flushing, and some patients experienced seizures (all patients had seizures noted before therapy as well). For this reason, patients will be hospitalized for 24 hours after therapy in the Department of Neurosurgery (UCK).

   However, in the case of poor tolerance to experimental treatment, it will not be continued. Additionally, steroid therapy will be initiated (if it had not been previously). In the event of a seizure, standard anticonvulsant treatment will be applied.

   Blood and urine tests will be performed 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after administering \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP.

   Assessment of Distribution of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP via SPECT/CT Imaging:
   * SPECT/CT imaging at two time points: 4 hours after the administration of the therapeutic radiopharmaceutical (after PET/CT imaging is complete) and 24 hours after its administration.
   * SPECT/CT imaging will follow a quantitative protocol developed at the Nuclear Medicine Department (UCK) based on phantom studies, including about 30 minutes of SPECT imaging using multiple energy windows and approximately 3 minutes of CT imaging at reduced exposure parameters, performed to locate the accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical and correct for radiation attenuation.
   * Before each subsequent administration and 2-4 weeks after administering \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP:

   Laboratory tests: Hematology, AST, ALT, Na, K, creatinine, urea, CRP, INR, D-dimers.

   Assessment of the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Barthel Index assessment. Assessment of adverse effects. f. Observation: The patient should remain hospitalized at the Department of Neurosurgery (UCK) for 24 hours after treatment with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP.

   Physical examination, neurological assessment, adverse events. 24 and 48 hours after the first administration of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP. MRI with contrast will be performed every 2 months to evaluate treatment efficacy and +/- 2 weeks before each administration of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP.

   Follow-up visits (including telemedicine options) will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and the therapeutic strategy used in the research center, every 2 months during the first 18 months or depending on the clinical status of the patient.

   After 18 months, scheduled follow-up visits (including telemedicine options) will take place every 3 months or more frequently if needed.

   g. Discontinuation of Therapy: The occurrence of serious adverse events (according to the definition related to TAT).

   Coexisting illness preventing further treatment. Progression of the lesion. In the case of the appearance of a new symptomatic solitary lesion in the MRI, treatment may continue at the researcher's discretion, provided that the initially treated lesion or area is stable or regressing.

   Withdrawal of the patient from the study. Changes in the patient's condition that, in the investigator's opinion, make further treatment impossible.

   The investigator may decide to withdraw the patient from the study for unforeseen reasons, ensuring their safety.

   .
5. Sample Size: The target sample size is 25 patients. Considering the possibility of patient dropouts, the group should include up to 35 patients. Patients will be recruited from those treated at the Departments of Neurosurgery (UCK, NIO).

   .
6. Study Endpoints:

Primary: overall survival (OS) measured from the date of diagnosis.

Secondary: time to progression (progression-free survival, PFS), defined as:

1. Clinical Progression: Clinical deterioration of performance status according to the Karnofsky scale or worsening of neurological function. The necessity of using or increasing the dose of corticosteroids by \>50%.
2. Progression on MRI:

Local progression within \< 4 cm from the border of the primary lesion after resection or, A new lesion on MRI or, Progression of the lesion on MRI by \> 25% between two consecutive imaging studies.

In differential diagnostics, radiation necrosis should be included as a treatment-related effect (MRI perfusion and/or biopsy).

* Expected Benefits of the Study: The expected outcome of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP with forced diffusion. It is anticipated that the proposed procedure should lead to an extension of survival time and time to disease progression compared to currently used therapeutic methods.

  .
* Description of Risks and Discomforts for Study Participants: Based on current experiences with the treatment of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP, no clinically significant side effects have been observed. The most frequently reported side effect was seizures (in all patients previously noted before therapy). No clinically significant side effects were identified in laboratory tests. There is no conclusive scientific evidence indicating that the administered local radioactivity poses a risk of developing cancer or hereditary defects. Current data suggest an extension of PFS and OS with the use of local treatment with \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTA-SP.

  .
* Study Duration with Justification: The estimated duration of the study is 3 years. Patients who remain alive at the end of the study will be monitored until they report death.

  .
* Biological Material: During reoperation and catheter placement, material will be collected for histopathological and genetic studies as per standard procedure.

  .
* Patient Data Anonymization: No identifiable patient data will be stored alongside medical data subject to analysis. Patient medical data will be analyzed anonymously but will have an individual number corresponding to the anonymization list for each patient.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06975332,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

For the cell therapy being used in this study, the genes or DNA within these gamma delta T cells are modified so they are resistant to or may not be affected by chemotherapy. The chemotherapy that is being used in this study is called temozolomide (TMZ) and can reduce the number of these gamma delta T cells or lymphocytes. This study will also find out if these modified gamma delta T cells (DRI) are unaffected by TMZ. The DRI is given in combination with a standard dose of TMZ and is administered into the brain where the tumor is located.

After subjects are consented in Parts A and B of the study, approximately about 2 tablespoons of blood will be collected for tests that may provide additional information about subjects T cells and how they may respond to treatment.

Part A Subjects will have a surgical procedure completed that will remove their tumor (called a surgical resection). They will have a Rickham catheter placed which is a device typically used to deliver chemotherapy into the brain. The infusion catheter will be placed first prior to the tumor resection. A sample of tumor tissue will be taken and examined to confirm the diagnosis of GBM. The diagnosis of GBM must be confirmed prior to beginning Part B.

Part B After the surgical resection and on Study Day 1, subjects will return to the study doctor's office/clinic to undergo a procedure called apheresis. This procedure will separate out cells called peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Apheresis is the removal of blood plasma from the body by collecting your blood and separating the plasma from the PBMCs. These cells include the gamma delta T cells that will be used to synthesize the DRI γδ T cells. Once the cells for the DRI γδ T cells are synthesized, they are reintroduced into subject's brain through the Rickham catheter.

Following apheresis and confirmation that the required number of gamma delta T cells were collected, subjects will begin the recommended or standard of care treatment for newly diagnosed GBM. This will include 6 weeks of chemotherapy with TMZ and radiation. Subjects will then have about 4 weeks of no treatment prior to beginning the Part B maintenance phase of treatment, which includes 6 cycles of TMZ. Depending on which dose level they receive, they will be administered either 1 injection of the DRI γδ T cells or 3 and these will be injected through the Rickham catheter.

The first 3 subjects will receive a single dose of the DRI γδ T cells at the lowest dose level. Subjects receiving a single dose of the DRI γδ T cells will be observed for a of minimum 30 days from the time the first subject is enrolled, followed by a minimum of 7 days between each additional subject enrolled to allow for evaluation of potential side effects. If the DRI γδ T cell injection does not cause serious side effects, the second set of 3 subjects will be enrolled. The second set of 3 patients will receive 3 doses of the DRI γδ T cells. The approximate duration of the study may be up to 15 years, or until disease progression or subjects withdraw from the study.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04165941,surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy,Adult,Primary,Surgery

The study aims to evaluate G-CSF's effects on brain health and cognitive function.

The name of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* G-CSF (also called Filgrastim)
* Temozolomide (TMZ), a standard of care chemotherapy drug","This is an open-label, randomized, phase II clinical study of using G-CSF in patients with newly diagnosed, MGMT-methylated, GBM treated with standard of care radiation with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide. The investigators are testing whether G-CSF can reduce the negative side effects from radiation and chemotherapy on brain health. The investigators are specifically testing the effects of G-CSF on brain structure, cognitive function, and general brain health, and the safety and tolerability of G-CSF.

Participants will be randomized, stratified by age, in a 1:1 fashion to receive either standard of care chemo-radiation (chemo-RT) in combination with G-CSF, or standard of care chemo-RT without G-CSF. Treatment with G-CSF will be initiated after chemo-RT and be completed after 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with Temozolomide.

This study involves screening for eligibility, standard of care radiation therapy and chemotherapy, study treatment and study visits, and follow-up visits. Participants will be in the study for up to 24 months, including 6 weeks of standard of care chemo-RT, up to 7 months of G-CSF treatment (depending on the number of additional chemotherapy cycles given as a part of standard care) and up to 12 months of active follow-up visits after study treatment ends.

Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a protein that stimulates bone marrow to produce stem cells and blood cells and release them into the bloodstream. It is known to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties (slowing or halting the loss of neurons). G-CSF is also called Filgrastim, and brand names include Granix®, Neupogen®, and Zarxio®. In addition to testing the safety and tolerability of G-CSF, the researchers in this study are testing whether or not G-CSF can protect cells in the brain or enhance repair in the brain after chemoradiation and during chemotherapy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved G-CSF to support brain health and cognitive function. However, G-CSF has been approved for several decades and in patients with any type of cancer who develop neutropenia (low white blood cell counts) following chemotherapy, including in patients with glioblastoma, or in patients following stem cell transplantation with low white cell blood counts.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved temozolomide as a treatment option for GBM. Temozolomide is given as standard of care chemotherapy in this study.

The radiation therapy used in this study is standard of care and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment option for GBM.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06649851,chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Regimen of Zactima + imatinib mesylate represents novel anti-glioma strategy because it targets 3 key mediators of dysregulated cell signalling involving VEGF \& PI3K-AKT pathways including VEGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) \& platelet derived growth factor(PDGFR). Furthermore by combining Zactima w imatinib mesylate, VEGF \& PI3-k/AKT pathways can potentially inhibit multiple mediators of each of these pathways. Regarding PI3-K/AKT signalling, regimen can inhibit activation of EGFR \& PDGFR. Regarding VEGF signalling, regimen has potential to inhibit 3 components of VEGFR directed angiogenesis. 1st, Zactima can directly inhibit VEGFR activation. 2nd, both Zactima \& imatinib mesylate can indirectly decrease activity of VEGF pathway by diminishing positive input from activated PI3-K/AKT signalling. 3rd, imatinib mesylate may inhibit PDGF-regulated pericyte maturation of tumor blood vessels.

We have previously demonstrated that regimen of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea is active regimen among recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) pts. Furthermore this activity appears substantially better than that reported for imatinib mesylate alone. Although mechanism of enhanced activity for imatinib mesylate when combo w hydroxyurea is unclear, it is logical to build upon combo of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea in subsequent studies rather than imatinib mesylate alone. Current study will therefore determine MTD of Zactima when combo w standard doses of imatinib mesylate \& hydroxyurea among RMG pts.

This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA. Initial therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. All patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). The investigators have shown in a previous phase I trial that a single Super-selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) of Bevacizumab (up to 15mg/kg) is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent GBM. Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an extension of that trial in that the investigators seek to test the hypothesis that repeated dosing of intraarterial Bevacizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent malignant glioma. By achieving the aims of this study the investigators will also determine if IV therapy with Bevacizumab should be combined with repeated selected intraarterial Bevacizumab to improve progression free and overall survival. The investigators expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of repeated SIACI Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to the patients in the near future.","The current standard of care for recurring GBM is for patients to receive Bevacizumab (Avastin) intravenously (IV) at 10mg/kg every two weeks until their tumor grows more than 25%. At that point, these patients are deemed treatment failures and are given another treatment. Because of the blood brain barrier (BBB) where IV drugs do not penetrate the blood vessel walls well to get into the brain, no one knows for sure if these IV drugs actually get into the brain after infusion. We have recently completed a Phase I clinical trial that has shown that SIACI of Bevacizumab is safe and effective up to a dose of 15mg/kg in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. This two arm open-label, non-randomized trial is a follow up study to that trial and will ask two simple questions: Is it safe to deliver repeated doses of Bevacizumab intraarterially using these super selective intraarterial delivery techniques? Is it necessary to combine this IA regimen of treatment with biweekly IV Bevacizumab in order to improve progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)? Information from this trial will yield important answers to the durability and efficacy of this delivery technique and may radically change the way chemotherapy is given to our patients with brain tumors.

Current Standard of Care:

Day 0: Intravenous Bevacizumab (10mg/kg) Day 14, 28 (and every two weeks thereafter): Intravenous Bevacizumab

Therefore the experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:

1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol 20%; 12.5 mL/s over 2 minutes) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma. We have used this without complication in the 30 patients from our Phase I protocol as well.
2. To treat patients with one of two arms with repeated intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of Bevacizumab for patients with recurring or relapsing high grade glioma. Each arm gets IA delivery with one arm getting IV Bevacizumab biweekly as well and the other arm not getting intervening IV therapy. In each arm, IA therapy is repeated when MRI shows progression. Persistent progression after three intraarterial chemotherapies would remove the patient from the trial.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01269853,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

The safety of combining G207 with a single low dose of radiation, designed to enhance virus replication and tumor cell killing, will also be tested.","Outcomes for children with recurrent or progressive supratentorial malignant brain tumors are very poor, and there are a lack of effective salvage therapies once a patient fails standard treatments.

G207 is an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV) that has been successfully engineered to introduce mutations in the virus that enable it to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells, but not normal cells. Replication of G207 in the tumor not only kills the infected tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus engenders an anti-tumor immune response; the virus is immunogenic and produces a debris field which exposes cancer cell antigens to immune cells which can target other cancer cells. Thus, the oncolytic effect of the virus and the immune response that the virus stimulates provide a one-two punch at attacking cancer cells. In preclinical studies, a single 5 Gy dose of radiation within 24 hours of virus inoculation to the tumor increased virus replication and tumor cell killing.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham has conducted three phase I trials of G207 injected into the recurrent tumor alone or combined with a single dose of radiation in adults with recurrent high-grade gliomas. In these trials, high doses (up to 3 x 10\^9 plaque-forming units) of virus were safely injected directly into the tumor or surrounding brain tissue without serious toxicities. A maximum tolerated dose was not reached in all 3 trials. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence of an antitumor response was seen in some patients. Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that a variety of aggressive pediatric brain tumor types are sensitive to G207.

This study is a phase I, open-label, single institution clinical trial of G207 alone or combined with a single low dose of radiation in children with recurrent or progressive supratentorial brain tumors. The primary goal is to determine safety. The secondary aims are to obtain preliminary information on the effectiveness of and immune response to G207.

Despite aggressive treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, these tumors have a dismal prognosis. Following a radiation therapy, almost 80% of them recur locally. The focus of this project is the development of a radiation sensitizer (a small molecule ATM inhibitor, WSD0628) with the goal to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy. The first step will be to establish a pre-clinical PK→PD→efficacy model to describe WSD0628 plasma and tumor concentrations associated with robust ATM inhibition and radiosensitizing effects. This model will be instrumental in interpreting the pharmacokinetic (PK) data and dosage selection in the proposed first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study in approximately 42 adult patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. The aims of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, PKs and preliminary anti-tumor activity of WSD0628 in combination with radiation therapy. The dose-escalation portion of the study (Part A) will enroll approximately 24 patients and is comprised of Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design with target toxicity rate of 22%-33%. Once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is established, Part B of the study will commence in which an additional 12 patients will be enrolled and treated at the RP2D for further evaluation of safety and efficacy (standard expansion cohort), and an additional 6 patients will have a tissue evaluation of tumor penetrance after a one-time dose of study drug prior to radiosurgery and surgical resection (Phase 0, tumor penetrance cohort).

The MTD for QD dosing will be determined. The initial dose level for QD dosing will be 60 mg (Dose Level 0). This dose is based on the phase 1 findings outlined in the rationale in the protocol, adding 1 dose level to test for a potential MTD increase.

Dose-escalation will occur in Stage 1:

* The initial dose (Dose Level 0) for QD MTD determination in Step 1 will be 60 mg. Dose levels will increase in 15 mg steps;
* The dose-escalation portion of the study (Stage 1) will use a standard ""3 + 3"" design to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of paxalisib administered orally in 28-day cycles;

NCT02331498,A Phase I/II Study of Pazopanib in Combination With Temozolomide in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme After Surgery and RT-CT,RECRUITING,"['PHASE1', 'PHASE2']",INTERVENTIONAL,51,ESTIMATED,"Pierre Yves BONDIAU, Dr.; Esma SAADA BOUZID, Dr; Jérôme BARRIERE, Pr.",2015-06,2030-08,2027-02,Centre Antoine Lacassagne,GlaxoSmithKline,Glioblastoma Multiforme,Pazopanib,18 years,70 years,ALL,A phase I/II study of pazopanib in combination with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme after surgery and RT-CT (PAZOGLIO study),"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and most malignant primary brain tumor, represents a major medical challenge considering its extremely poor prognosis (Wen 2008). Current standard of care includes maximal surgical resection, followed by concomitant radio-chemotherapy (temozolomide - TMZ) (RT-CT) followed by 6 months of maintenance TMZ, with a median overall survival (mOS) of 14.6 vs. 12.1 months with RT alone (Stupp 2005). Non operable GBM, represents around 30% of cases of GBM, with a poorer prognosis, a median PFS of 3-4 months and a median OS between 6-9 months (Chinot 2007, Stupp 2009), with concomitant RT-CT treatment. Therefore, innovative treatment strategies are urgently needed and new treatment combinations evaluated in phase I studies are highly encouraged (Wen 2011).

Since GBM is one of the most vascularised cancers, antiangiogenic agents have been tested and used firstly in recurrent GBM. Among them, Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has shown high response rate between 19% and 62% in several Phase 2 and multiple retrospective studies, alone or in combination with chemotherapy (Chamberlain 2011). Two randomized phase III trials, AVAGLIO and RTOG 0825, investigating the efficacy of Bevacizumab added or not to the Stupp protocol in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, have been presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO 2013). While both studies exhibited a significant progression-free survival (PFS) improvement (RTOG 0825:10.7 vs. 7.3m, p=0.007; AVAGLIO: 10.6 vs. 6.2m, p\<0.0001), there was no gain in overall survival.

Other antiangiogenic agents have been studied in GBM patients (Sathornsumetee 2009, Van Meir 2010, Wick 2011), with encouraging results but still insufficient when used as single agents. Among them, pazopanib is thought to be promising. It is an orally tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potently inhibition of VEGFR-1, -2, -3, c-kit and PDGFR-α, -β (Castaneda 2009, Schutz 2011). Interestingly, these 2 PDGFR subtypes are overexpressed in malignant gliomas (Verhaak 2010). Furthermore, pazopanib is already validated in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and soft-tissue sarcomas (Sleijfer 2009, Sternberg 2010).

A phase II trial evaluated efficacy and safety of pazopanib in 35 patients with recurrent GBM (Iwamoto 2010). Two patients had a partial radiographic response by standard bidimensional measurements, whereas 9 patients (6 at the 8-week point and 3 only within the first month of treatment) had decreased contrast enhancement, vasogenic edema, and mass effect but \<50% reduction in tumor. The median PFS was 12 weeks and mOS was 35 weeks. Pazopanib was reasonably well tolerated with a spectrum of toxicities similar to other anti-VEGF/VEGFR agents and with unexpected toxicity.

Given the emerging concern that pure anti-VEGF inhibition may promote malignant glial cell invasiveness (Keunen 2011), we consider essential to combine a multitargeted antiangiogenic agent, such as pazopanib, with the current standard treatment. TMZ was chosen not only because it represents the current standard of care but because of its very good penetration in the brain parenchyma and its low hepatic metabolism, making very unlikely the occurrence of a pharmacokinetic interaction with pazopanib (Friedman 2000). Indeed, phase I trials of TMZ in combination with molecules such as RAD001, cilengitide, gefitinib or irinotecan showed no need for dose modification of TMZ. Similarly, the Phase I trials of pazopanib association with paclitaxel or FOLFOX6 have been conducted up to a dose of 800 mg daily, the recommended dose of pazopanib in monotherapy, with standard doses of chemotherapy (Tan 2010, Brady 2009). Finally, the study of the toxicity profile of pazopanib and TMZ does not suggest a specific limiting dose escalation adverse event, except perhaps asthenia, thrombocytopenia or ALAT elevation. However, considering the high level of potential toxicity when an ITK is administered with radiations, pazopanib should not be administered in the induction phase of the Stupp protocol.

Therefore, based on a strong synergy rational, the study coordinator aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pazopanib in combination with TMZ in the maintenance phase of the Stupp protocol. The study coordinator hopes that this strategy could significantly improve the poor prognosis of these patients.

This study is a multicenter Phase I/II trial, which aims to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of pazopanib in combination with TMZ. The study coordinator will associate a multidisciplinary approach involving translational pharmacokinetic studies, and research on potential predictive biomarkers of response through pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic approachs. This study will include patients with not previously treated GBM, candidates for a complete or partial surgical resection and who are eligible for adjuvant treatment based on a combination of TMZ and radiotherapy.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02331498,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Following diagnosis of relapsing glioblastoma by either brain CT scan or MRI, patients will be randomized in 2 arms:

1. Arm 1: IMA950 mixed with Poly-ICLC administered subcutaneously
2. Arm 2: Pembrolizumab 200mg q3w IV and IMA950 mixed with Poly-ICLC administered subcutaneously

The first phase of treatment will last 6 weeks, then surgery will be performed (done if clinically possible ad indicated). In case of available brain tissue, extensive analysis of the tumor immune response will be performed. Assessment of systemic immune response by PBMC immunomonitoring will be systematically done before and after surgery.","Brain tumors are the first cause of cancer mortality in children and the 3rd cause in young adults. The most frequent brain tumors are gliomas and among them the most common type is astrocytoma. The most malignant astrocytoma is Glioblastoma (GBM). Standard therapy of newly diagnosed GBM patients includes surgery, irradiation and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy with 1-year and 5-year survival rates at 30% and 3%, respectively. For the treatment of recurrent GBM, TMZ is widely used even if the optimal dosing schedule and the minimal time interval from first line are unknown. Other appropriate therapeutic options include Lomustine, an alkylating drug, and Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic agent targeting VEGF-A, approved only in selected countries (i.e. North America, Switzerland). Controlled trials are rare for recurrent glioblastoma, consequently therapeutic decisions are mostly based on low-level evidence.

Amongst innovative strategies, immunotherapy is considered as one of the most promising. Immunotherapy stimulates the natural properties of the immune system to protect against cancer growth. Therapeutic vaccines (active immunotherapy) are expected to elicit a cytotoxic immune response to tumor-associated antigens, destroying malignant cells without harming normal cells. The cells involved in this response are T lymphocytes, which can sense abnormal peptides at the tumor cells surface. One critical step towards the development of therapeutic vaccines was the identification and validation of glioma antigens. This is an obstacle the investigators have circumvented with the characterization of several immunogenic glioma peptides by screening the peptidome of ex vivo human glioma samples. This led to the development of a multipeptide vaccine called IMA950.

IMA950 is composed of 9 synthetic tumor-associated HLA-A2-restricted peptides (TUMAPs), two MHC class II-binding peptides and one HLA-A2-restricted HBV-derived peptide, the latter used as marker of vaccine immunogenicity. The HLA-A2 allele is expressed by approximately 45% of the Swiss population. As the interactions between peptides and their corresponding HLA molecule are highly specific, only HLA-A\*02 positive patients will be included in this trial. The reasons why this set of peptides is very promising for vaccination are as follows:

1. Tumor peptides have been isolated from ex vivo samples:
2. They are over-expressed in glioma (compared to normal tissues)
3. They are derived from proteins involved in the malignant process
4. They are immunogenic in vitro in healthy donors and in glioma patients
5. This is a MULTI-peptide vaccine IMA950 was investigated in a monocentric phase I/II trial for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and WHO grade III gliomas using poly-ICLC as adjuvant (PI: P-Y. Dietrich, NCT01920191, study completed, final results in preparation for publication). A total of 19 patients (16 with GBM and 3 with anaplastic astrocytoma) were included, with a median number of 9 injections received per patient (range: 4-11). The multipeptide vaccine did not show any serious safety issues, apart from some mild inflammatory reactions at the injection site, peritumoral or resection cavity edema/tumor flare manageable with steroids, as well as peri-vaccinational transient mild headache, fatigue and flu-like syndrome (grade 3 events: 42.1%, grade 4 events: 21%, no grade 5 events). Regarding vaccine immunogenicity, CD4 T-cell responses were detected in the majority of patients (58%) and were usually sustained. The CD8 T-cell responses were detected in 63% of patients, with 37% of them being multi-TUMAP responders. Median overall survival from date of surgery was 21 months (range: 10 - 41 months) for the overall cohort, with a 19 months survival for the GBM-only cohort (range: 10-41 months), which compares favorably with the reported median survival of 15 months with the reference treatment of temozolomide-based chemoradiation. PFS was 93% and 56% at 6 and 9 months respectively.

Despite the T cell ability to detect tumor peptides that are naturally presented by tumor cells, these T cells do not normally become activated and do not protect the body against the cancer, as tumor cells on their own are only poorly immunogenic. For effective T cell activation, the help of co-stimulatory molecules, which are expressed on activated professional APCs, e.g. dendritic cells, is required. During infections, the activation of APCs is triggered by molecular patterns common to all pathogens of a class (e.g. RNA viruses). These patterns, also referred to as ""danger signals"", are not provided by peptides themselves. Consequently, artificial danger signals have to be provided with a tumor vaccine to induce the required co-stimulation on APCs. In combination with a vaccine, such substances with a non-specific immunostimulatory effect are called adjuvants. Poly-ICLC, (Hiltonol®, Oncovir) is a synthetic double-stranded ribo-nucleic acid (dsRNA) mimicking viral pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) that activates multiple elements of innate and adaptive immunity.

The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic cells has been known for decades. The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-regulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. Binding of PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) to the PD-1 receptor inhibits T-cell activation triggered through the T-cell receptor. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda™) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. Impressive response rate and prolonged survival were first observed for metastatic melanoma, but the clinical benefit of this mAb was recently shown to extend to several other cancer types. There is a strong rationale to investigate the role of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in malignant glioma, since (i) we and others have previously reported that PD-L1 expression by glioma cells may contribute to tumor-related immunoresistance; (ii) PD-L1 is also expressed by tumor-infiltrating macrophages and circulating monocytes; (iii) expression of PD-L1 on circulating monocytes was shown to correlate with worsened survival in patients who received the HSPPC-96 vaccine for newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM. The 200 mg Q3W dose will maintain individual patient exposures within the exposure range demonstrated to be well tolerated, safe and established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response. A fixed dose regimen simplifies the dosing regimen so as to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce the potential for dosing errors.

The combination of pembrolizumab with a vaccine therapy is currently being tested in several trials for different tumors, such as melanoma, bladder, colorectal and prostate cancer (NCT02574533, NCT02054520, NCT02432963, NCT02499835, NCT02515227). Here the investigators postulate that Pembrolizumab may improve the immunogenicity of the IMA950 vaccine and the function of vaccine-induced glioma-specific T cells, and that the multipeptide vaccine may help to focus the immune response against antigens overexpressed by glioma, leading together to an optimization of the antitumor immune effect whilst reducing the risk of collateral damage to the brain.

The study aims to answer questions regarding safety (for the future clinical development of this strategy), immunogenicity (synergy between multipeptide vaccine and pembrolizumab) and clinical outcome. Ancillary translational research should help to identify possible correlation between neo-epitopes, methylation status, immune response and clinical outcome.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03665545,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy; pediatric,Adult,Metastatic,Post-Surgery

It has the potential to inhibit directly the growth of multiple tumour types by the inhibition of multiple targets and to act negatively on antiangiogenesis.

Glioblastoma (GB) is the most frequent brain tumour. Standard treatment after surgical resection is radiation therapy with Temozolomide. But patients who can afford only a biopsy of their lesion due to the location in eloquent areas of their tumour or multifocality, don't get benefit from such treatment and their median survival is in the best case of only 9 months. These patients constitute 30% of Glioblastomas. Clinical trials in this setting are required as patients should be treated immediately after the biopsy to prevent neurological deterioration.

These patients are ideal to test new promising therapies. Their survival is similar to recurrent patients. The evaluation of response is easier as it's possible to avoid the confounding post-surgical changes that interfere with the evaluation of treatment efficacy in terms of tumour size reduction.. Furthermore, neo adjuvant treatment before radiotherapy has shown not to worsen their survival.

Glioblastoma is a tumour rich in molecular abnormalities. PDGFRs are important in growth signalling pathways and neoangiogenesis of gliomas. PDGF ligands and PDGFR-alfa are expressed in most human gliomas, while PDGFR-beta is expressed in glioma cells and tumor endothelial cells, PDFGR-α is expressed in most human gliomas. Imatinib mesylate exhibited antiglioma activity in preclinical studies, sensitizes glioma cells to radiation injury, and combined with hydroxyurea has shown promising results in the recurrent setting.

Moreover gliomas are among the most angiogenic cancers. VEGF/VEGFR-2 is the most prominent angiogenic signalling pathway. Its inhibition either by a neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody, anti-sense VEGF constructs, expression of a dominant-negative mutant form of VEGFR-2 (a specific small molecule inhibitor of the VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase) or neutralizing anti-VEGFR-2 antibody has resulted in suppression of experimental malignant glioma growth. VEGF has been the focus in the development of glioma-targeted therapies. Recently Bevacizumab has shown to be active in phase II studies.

For these reasons, Sunitinib seems to be a promising treatment fo The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the clinical activity of Sunitinib as first line therapy in patients who have measurable disease and to evaluate the safety of Sunitinib with radiation therapy.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01100177,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

However, its impact on patient outcome defined as survival, costs, and/or quality of life has not been demonstrated. Regulatory agencies require randomized trials to determine the impact of PET on patient management and outcome. In this study we hypothesize that the addition of 18F-DOPA PET will improve patient outcome by more accurately identifying presence or absence of tumor recurrence than conventional imaging.","Malignant gliomas are aggressive primary brain tumors that almost always lead to rapid patient deterioration and death. Timely diagnosis of recurrent disease as well as accurate monitoring of therapeutic responses is critically important in glioblastoma patients.

Despite introduction of new treatment approaches patient prognosis is poor with less than half of the patients being progression-free during the first 6 months after diagnosis of disease recurrence (6-month-progression-free survival rates of 46%).

The current diagnostic standard of care for diagnosing and monitoring brain tumors is contrast-enhanced, multi-planar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the ability of MRI for early detection of disease recurrence or progression is limited. Moreover, determination of treatment responses is difficult since benign tissue changes after radiation and/or chemotherapy can have the appearance of tumor recurrence or progression on MRI. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an established imaging technique that utilizes small amounts of radioactivity attached to very minimal amounts of substances (tracers) that are injected via a hand or arm vein. These substances can track certain features of cancers that can be visualized by using the PET/CT scanner. For instance, a number of different PET-tracers have been used to study brain tumor metabolism and to detect primary or recurrent tumors. These include tracers of glucose (18F-FDG) and amino acid metabolism (e.g. 18F-DOPA). Metabolic imaging of brain tumors with amino acid analogues has advantages over 18F-FDG. Since FDG assess glucose metabolism and the normal brain consumes a lot of glucose it can be difficult to detect tumors against high glucose use of normal brain tissue. 18FDOPA has been successfully used clinically for many years. The advantage of 18F-DOPA is that normal brain tissue consumes very little 18F-DOPA. Thus, tumors can be seen easily against a low background activity.

18F-DOPA PET imaging detects brain tumors with a very high accuracy and 18F-DOPA imaging affects the management of 40% of patients. However, its impact on patient outcome defined as survival, costs, and/or quality of life has not been demonstrated.

Randomized trials are needed to evaluate the impact of PET on patient management and outcome. We will determine this by randomizing patients with suspected recurrence of glioblastoma into those who are managed using conventional diagnostic imaging versus those who will receive conventional imaging plus 18F-DOPA PET. Randomization is like flipping a coin. Patients will have a 50% chance to undergo standard imaging or standard imaging combined with 18F-DOPA PET.

Approximately 25-40% of the patients with suspected tumor recurrence will have pseudo-progression on MRI (i.e. the images suggest that there is tumor recurrence when there is in fact no recurrence). These patients will have correctly negative 18F-DOPA PET scans. In these patient initiation of treatment can be postponed. In contrast, patients with positive 18F-DOPA PET scans will undergo some kind of treatment at the discretion of the treating physician (radiation therapy, chemotherapy or surgery). We will find out whether the management and treatment change that is based on 18FDOPA PET affects the survival of patients and affects the costs of caring for the patients.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01813877,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Does NRG103 prolong overall survival or disease-free survival in patients with GBM? What medical problems do participants have when receiving NRG103 treatment? Researchers will give patients with NRG103 to see if NRG103 works to treat recurrent GBM.

Participants will:

Receive NRG103 twice in 14 days Visit the clinic once every 2 weeks for checkups and tests Keep a diary of their symptoms","The annual incidence rate of malignant brain tumors in China is 4.2/100000, and GBM accounts for 50.9%. GBM is highly invasive and malignant. After undergoing anti-tumor treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the short-term recurrence rate is extremely high. The median survival time after recurrence is only 9 months, and the 1-year survival rate is 30%. It is urgent to explore new therapy strategy.

Transgenic oncolytic virus therapy for GBM is an emerging anti-tumor therapy. The genetically engineered oncolytic virus has improved selectivity towards tumor cells, replicating and lysing only within infected tumor cells, while activating the body's immune system to launch a more extensive attack on tumors. At present, various genetically modified oncolytic viruses targeting GBM have entered the clinical trial stage both domestically and internationally. For example, G47Δ, with superior anti-tumor activity and good safety in early clinical trials, has been conditionally approved for marketing in Japan for the treatment of malignant gliomas. DNX-2401, JL15003, and others are also in the early stages of clinical research. NRG-103 is an innovative gene therapy drug developed based on the in situ trans-differentiation technology. Through multiple mutation modifications of the adenovirus genome, it can enhance the specific recognition and killing effect of oncolytic virus on GBM tumor cells without being limited by tumor gene phenotype, and regulate the immune microenvironment to induce stronger anti-tumor immune response. In addition, the two transcription factors expressed on NRG-103 can efficiently transdifferentiate residual GBM tumor cells into non tumor like neuronal cells, in order to achieve the goal of delaying tumor recurrence and long-term survival. NRG-103 exhibits significant anti-tumor activity and clear in situ trans-differentiation effects in preclinical models, providing scientific evidence for the potential clinical efficacy of NRG-103.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06757153,chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Primary

* Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine rapidly disintegrating tablets (RDT) administered concurrently with radiotherapy in young patients with newly diagnosed, nondisseminated intrinsic brain stem glioma or high-grade glioma.
* Describe the dose-limiting toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

Secondary

* Describe the safety profile of this regimen.
* Characterize the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine RDT in these patients.
* Explore the exposure-response relationship for measures of safety and effectiveness using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models.
* Describe the antitumor activity of this regimen observed in these patients.
* Estimate distributions of progression-free survival and survival in patients treated with this regimen.

The primary objective is to determine the failure rate of a restrictive DEX regimen defined as edema or mass effect leading to any of the following: GCS deterioration ≥ 2 points, NIHSS increase ≥ 3 points, increase of midline Shift ≥ 2mm, or any surgical rescue procedure for increasing mass effect.","Background

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and devastating malignant brain tumor in adults. Patients with glioblastoma face a poor prognosis. Despite maximal treatment, most patients suffer tumor progression after 6-7 months and die within 1-2 years. Standard treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma contains maximal safe surgery and adjuvant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. Additional administration of steroids has established as standard of care during treatment of GBM. It is widely used during the entire course of the disease including pre- and postoperative management, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Dexamethasone (DEX) is the most frequently used steroid. The main purpose is to reduce the tumor associated vasogenic cerebral edema, to prevent or treat increased intracranial pressure. In addition, DEX helps to cope with adverse effects of GBM-treatment like nausea, vomiting and fatigue. However, steroids are also linked to a multitude of adverse side effects that may affect the survival of GBM patients such as major immunosuppression, and metabolic changes like hyperglycemia. The use of steroids during radiotherapy is associated with reduced overall- and progression-free survival and has been identified as an independent poor prognostic factor. DEX was also related to a poor prognosis in recurrent GBM. Despite these findings, in routine clinical practice, the suspicion of glioblastoma often triggers the administration of DEX, regardless of neurologic symptoms or the extension of cerebral edema. Many patients are treated with larger doses of DEX per day before being referred to a neurosurgical center and are kept on steroids during the entire treatment. On the other hand, the clinical experience shows that GBM-patients with no, or only mild neurologic symptoms, normal intracranial pressure and relatively small cerebral edema can be managed without administration of DEX. The rationale for this study is to objectify the criteria and safety of a restrictive DEX regimen (based on standardized clinical and radiological criteria). A restrictive DEX regimen may help to reduce over-use, limit the number of patients exposed to the adverse effects of DEX, and potentially improve survival in GBM-patients. The purpose of this study is to assess whether selected GBM patients can be treated safely with a restrictive DEX regimen from referral to the neurosurgical center until discharge.

Objective

The primary objective is to determine the failure rate of a restrictive DEX regimen defined as edema or mass effect leading to any of the following: GCS deterioration ≥ 2 points, NIHSS increase ≥ 3 points, increase of midline Shift ≥ 2mm, or any surgical rescue procedure for increasing mass effect.

Methods

All patients referred to the neurosurgical center with suspicion of glioblastoma are screened for inclusion- and exclusion criteria. If eligible and consenting of the patient to the study protocol, no steroids will be administered until discharge (except optional intraoperative single shot dexamethasone of max. 4mg if necessary). If steroids have been administered for a maximum of one day before referral, they will be stopped immediately. Patients are followed clinically. If one of the above-described failure criteria occurs, the primary endpoint is reached and DEX will be administered.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04266977,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Neural stem cells can travel to sites of tumor in the brain. The neural stem cells that are being used in this study were genetically modified express the enzyme cytosine deaminase (CD), which converts the prodrug flucytosine (5-FC) into the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Leucovorin may help 5-FU kill more tumor cells. The CD-expressing neural stem cells are administered directly into the brain. After giving the neural stem cells a few days to spread out and migrate to tumor cells, research participants take a 7 day course of oral 5-FC. (Depending on when a research participant enters the study, they may also be given leucovorin to take with the 5-FC.) When the 5-FC crosses into brain, the neural stem cells convert it into 5-FU, which diffuses out of the neural stem cells to preferentially kill rapidly dividing tumor cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy tissues. A Rickham catheter, placed at the time of surgery, will be used to administer additional doses of NSCs every two weeks, followed each time by a 7 day course of oral 5-FC (and possibly leucovorin). This neural stem cell-based anti-cancer strategy may be an effective treatment for high-grade gliomas.

Funding Source - FDA OOPD","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To define the phase II recommended dose of intracerebrally administered cytosine deaminase (CD)-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs) in combination with oral 5-fluorocytosine (FC) (flucytosine) and leucovorin.

II. To determine the feasibility of treating study patients with more than 1 dose of NSCs followed by 7-day courses of 5-FC and leucovorin.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess for possible development of NSC immunogenicity (anti-NSC T cell and/or antibody response) with repeat doses of NSCs.

II. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of 5-FC and 5-FU at the maximum tolerated dose/maximum feasible dose level.

III. To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete response) of this treatment regimen.

IV. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.

OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of CD-expressing genetically modified neural stem cells and flucytosine.

Patients receive CD-expressing neural stem cells intracranially (IC) on days 1 and 15 and flucytosine orally (PO) every 6 hours on days 4-10 and 18-24. Depending on when a subject enters the study, they may also be given leucovorin orally every 6 hours on days 4-10 and 18-24. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then annually thereafter.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02015819,chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery
NCT04845919,A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Safety and Feasibility of Sonodynamic Therapy Using the ExAblate MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound in the Treatment of Cerebral Glioblastomas.,COMPLETED,['PHASE2'],INTERVENTIONAL,5,ACTUAL,,2/22/2023,10/30/2024,10/30/2024,Fondazione I.R.C.C.S. Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta,,Glioblastoma Multiforme,5-Aminolevulinic Acid,18 years,70 years,ALL,"The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of sonodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid in patients with newly diagnosed cerebral glioblastomas using the ExAblate Model 4000 Type-2 ""Neuro-System"".

Patients will be consented, screened, and will undergo study SDT treatment with 5-ALA using the ExAblate Model 4000 Type-2 ""Neuro-System"". After SDT treatment, patients will perform a strict neuro-radiological follow-up (minimum of 2 MRI) and undergo tumor resection 15-21 days after SDT, according to the clinical and radiological status.

The main goal of the present study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of SDT in patients affected by GBMs attained with low-frequency FUS.

In particular:

Safety will be evaluated by patient examination and MRI images during the treatment, and by follow-up MRI and clinical and neurological visits.

To evaluate feasibility, the extent of the sonicated area will be calculated at the end of the procedure in order to evaluate the targeted area.

Secondary objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy of the SDT procedure in terms of tumor regression and/or cell apoptosis and necrosis.","Despite progress made in many cancer treatments, High-Grade Gliomas (HGG) remain an extraordinary challenge. Their aggressive and infiltrative nature, the limited efficacy and inherent risk of surgical resection combined with radiotherapy, and the difficulty in delivering anticancer drugs to the brain, make the prognosis for patients with gliomas grim. Therefore, new and less-invasive alternatives to existing procedures are needed.

Sono-Dynamic Therapy (SDT) represents an emerging approach that offers the possibility of noninvasively eradicating solid tumors in a site-directed manner. It involves the delivery of a non-toxic chemical agent that selectively accumulates into target areas and the subsequent exposure of the targeted tissue to relatively low-intensity ultrasound. These procedures (sensitization and ultrasound exposure) are both per se harmless, but, when combined, result in activation of the chemical agent and subsequent cytotoxic events limited to the target tissue volume. SDT offers significant advantages because ultrasound energy can be tightly focused and delivered through the intact skull to deep areas of the brain, depending on the frequency. SDT is achieved by focusing low-intensity and lowfrequency ultrasound, which, as opposite to high-intensity ultrasonic beams, can be focused effectively within the whole intracranial space with the currently available device ExAblate 4000, Insightec, Haifa, Israel). This would enable to target also tumors in the peripheral area of the intracranial space. 5-ALA is a PpIX (Protoporphyrin IX) precursor that selectively accumulates in HGGs because of an enhanced uptake and metabolism from tumor cells. It is used for intra-operative guidance in surgery as tumoral tissues shows an exceeding fluorescence under certain light conditions due to PpIX accumulation, as compared to the normal surrounding parenchyma. It is therefore a good candidate for SDT. 5-ALA can exert sono-dynamic effects against HGGs, as it has been shown in several preclinical studies. Pre-clinical data on a safety experiment conducted at the University of Virginia showed that SDT with 5-ALA was not exerting a toxic effect to the normal brain \[Raspagliesi L. et al. 2021\].

The idea of the present study is to investigate the antitumor effects of SDT in patients affected by HGGs attained with low-frequency Focused Ultrasound. Focused Ultrasound under MRI-guidance can be safely delivered through an intact human skull to perform SDT in combination with 5-ALA with a low risk of transient adverse effects, and will be evaluated during follow-up visits, postprocedural serial MRI, and histology.

The main goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SDT in patients with newly diagnosed cerebral glioblastomas using the ExAblate Model 4000 Type-2 ""Neuro-System"". The ExAblate Model 4000 Type-2 ""Neuro-System"" is intended for use as a tool to induce targeted tumor's inhibition of growth and cell destruction in patients with cerebral lobar glioblastomas.

Patients harboring newly diagnosed lobar glioblastoma according to RANO criteria will provide informed consent, will be screened, and will undergo study SDT treatment using the ExAblate Model 4000 Type-2 ""Neuro-System"". After SDT treatment, patients will perform a strict neuro-radiological follow-up (minimum of 2 MRI) and undergo tumor resection about 15-21 days after SDT, according to the clinical and radiological status.

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SDT. In particular, safety will be evaluated by patient examination and MRI during the treatment, and by follow-up by daily clinical visits and MRI every 5 (± 2) days according to clinical and radiologic findings. Safety data will be assessed during each visit through a combination of MRI evaluations, clinical assessments, and neurological examinations, according to the clinical findings assessed until the decision to proceed with surgical resection. Feasibility will be evaluated performing 4 MRI (Day 1, 5, 10, 15) after SDT treatment evaluating tumor size, morphology and perilesional edema until tumor resection.

A secondary objective of the present study is to assess the efficacy of the treatment; in particular, to investigate the antitumor effects of SDT in patients affected by HGGs attained with low-frequency

Focused Ultrasound, the following data will be collected:

* Tumor volume changes after SDT according to sonicated tumors volumes (by imaging).
* Histology after tumor resection, comprising assessment of apoptosis and necrosis.

Despite all current treatment modalities, glioblastoma patient's prognosis remains dismal. By proving that procedure is safe and feasible this study will establish the SDT treatment modality as a possible alternative or a synergistic tool to current treatment modalities. It will also pave the way to the application of SDT in other forms of brain tumors, both intra- and extra-axial, and to the development of tumor specific sono-sensitizers.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04845919,imaging; surgery,Adult,Primary,Surgery

An energy restricted ketogenic diet is a diet designed to keep blood sugars in the low range of normal while at the same time increasing the blood concentration of metabolic break down products called ketones. This diet is currently used to treat children with uncontrollable seizures. This diet is well tolerated by the children with minimal side effects reported after using the diet for years.

* Another reason for doing this study is to learn about the side effects associated with the energy restricted ketogenic diet in patients with primary brain cancer.","Summary: The current standard of care for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary brain tumor in adults, includes surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy. Survival rarely exceeds 18 months. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that brain tumor cells are unable to utilize ketones as a source of energy when deprived of glucose, due to mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas normal glia and neurons can survive this metabolic stress. A nutritionally adequate but energy restricted, ketogenic diet (ERKD) to deprive brain tumors of energy and resulting in death of glioma cells is promising. ERKD-based therapy to manage brain cancer is both biologically plausible and supported by data in animal models. A multidisciplinary team of oncologists, registered dietitians, and physiologists will implement an ERKD therapy in newly diagnosed GBM subjects. After initial maximal tumor excision, ERKD therapy will be initiated for subjects during a one week inpatient admission to Sparrow Hospital or as a local outpatient and supervised by registered dietitians experienced in implementing this therapy.The ERKD will continue as adjunctive therapy along with radiation therapy and standard of care chemotherapy. The supervised ERKD will continue for an additional 6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy along with the standard of care chemotherapy.

* To evaluate the safety of basiliximab in these patients.
* To determine if basiliximab enhances the magnitude or character of pp65-specific vaccine-induced cellular or humoral immune responses, inhibits or enhances activation-induced cell death, or induces immunologic or clinical evidence of autoimmunity.
* To determine if basiliximab alters the phenotype (CD56 expression), cytokine secretion profile, or cytotoxicity of CD3-CD56+ natural killer cells.

NCT06797661,Insights Into the Pathophysiology of Neurovascular Uncoupling in Patients with Brain Lesions.,RECRUITING,['NA'],INTERVENTIONAL,40,ESTIMATED,,2/17/2025,12/31/2026,6/1/2026,Erasme University Hospital,,Glioblastoma; Glioma; Astrocytoma,Functional MRI; FDG-PET; Structural MRI,18 years,90 years,ALL,"Neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) represents a major source of potential bias for the identification of eloquent brain regions through activation procedures in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Same region shows proper pattern in glucose metabolism in victiny of brain lesions, investigated with positron emitted tomography with radiolabeled glucose (PET-FDG) This research project aims at investigating the mechanisms of NVU by using a multimodal noninvasive imaging approach in neurosurgical patients.","Brain metabolism and blood flow are tightly coupled with neuronal activity. Changes in neuronal activity result in the modulation of glucose consumption by neurons. Both glucose and lactate levels return to their baseline instantly as neuronal activity ceases, a phenomenon known as neurometabolic coupling. Given the limited energetic reserves in the central nervous system, neuronal activity heavily relies on the finely regulated supply of glucose from the bloodstream. However, the dynamic increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) during neuronal activation far exceeds the increase in oxidative metabolism. This relative hyperemic response ensures an increased oxygen gradient between blood vessels and tissue, providing ample oxygen supply. The close temporal and regional link between changes in neuronal activity and CBF increase is referred to as neurovascular coupling (NVC) and involves a complex cascade of events. Neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, released at synapses bind to receptors on neurons and astrocytes, leading to the release of various chemical mediators, like nitric oxide and prostaglandins, which directly act on arterial smooth muscle tone. More complex and incompletely understood signaling pathways, including Na+ and Ca2+-mediated astrocyte signaling mechanisms, are also presumed to contribute to NVC.

The tight relationship between neuronal activity and both regional blood flow and metabolism has provided the basis for non-invasive functional brain imaging methods, including positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). PET using \[18Fluor \]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a technique based on the accumulation of metabolized FDG (i.e., FDG-6-phosphate) in the astrocyte-neuron complex, reflecting the level of glucose consumption. Since the seminal works of Sokoloff et al., glucose utilization is considered a valid, accurate, and quantitative indicator of the level of local neuronal activity within the brain. In contrast, fMRI, which relies on the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, provides indirect information about neuronal activity by investigating perfusion-related changes coupled with neuronal activity. In areas of increased CBF due to modulations in neuronal activity, oxygen delivery exceeds the rate of oxygen utilization, inducing a local increase in the oxy-/deoxy-hemoglobin ratio. This leads to a detectable increase in the magnetic-susceptibility weighted MRI signal.

One of the earliest and still recognized clinical applications of fMRI has been preoperative functional mapping of the primary sensorimotor cortex in patients with brain tumors. This technique has significantly impacted surgical planning, often enabling more aggressive approaches than those considered without functional localization. fMRI has also been increasingly used in the presurgical evaluation of patients with vascular or epileptogenic lesions. However, despite the growing use of BOLD fMRI in patients with brain lesions, this technique has major limitations that must be considered when interpreting fMRI results in such populations. The main limitation is the impairment of BOLD signal changes due to lesion-related loss of normal vascular coupling with neuronal activity, a phenomenon referred to as neurovascular uncoupling (NVU). This can result in false-negative or false-positive results in critical eloquent cortex. If neuronal activity is preserved in diseased but viable cortex, NVU is presumed to occur due to astrocytic, neurotransmitter, or vascular dysfunction.

NVU has been mainly reported in patients with high-grade glial tumors and meningiomas. In such patients, the volume of task-based fMRI signal increases has been shown to be reduced adjacent to the tumor compared to homologous fMRI signal changes in the contralesional hemisphere, despite the absence of neurological deficit. In line with experimental data in healthy subjects showing that BOLD signal may decrease as cerebral blood volume (CBV) increases, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in brain tumor patients may be explained by changes in local perfusion. In hypervascularized tumors such as high-grade gliomas and meningiomas, local hyperperfusion has been suggested to explain the decreased BOLD signal on task-based fMRI. However, recent studies have demonstrated that NVU may also occur in low-grade gliomas. Given the absence of hyperperfusion in this tumor type, different mechanisms need to be considered. In low-grade gliomas, the observed NVU is currently thought to be, at least in part, due to disruption of astrocyte-vascular coupling (gliovascular uncoupling). Patients with arteriovenous malformations may exhibit impaired peri-nidal cerebrovascular reserve due to high-flow shunting, making perfusion-dependent mapping signals unreliable. Epilepsy patients may also exhibit regional impairment of CVR due to dramatic increases in brain metabolism and CBF during the ictal period, disruption of the brain-blood barrier, and an acute loss of cerebral pressure autoregulation.

According to previous research, CVR can be studied through the ""hypercapnia challenge"" during fMRI recordings, including breath-hold fMRI (BH fMRI) and carbogen inhalation fMRI. Hypercapnia is a potent vasodilator that increases the BOLD baseline signal by detecting an increase in tissue oxygenation resulting from increases in CBF while oxidative metabolism demands are considered to remain constant. However, the influence of hypercapnia on neural activity and neurometabolic/neurovascular couplings is not well understood and remains debated. In practice, areas of reduced or absent hypercapnia-induced increase in fMRI signal on CVR maps compared to homologous contralateral activation are assumed to indicate NVU. Recent studies suggest potential advantages in using resting-state (rs) fMRI as a preoperative technique. rs-fMRI is a functional neuroimaging technique that allows the measurement of spontaneous brain activity in patients at rest. Spontaneous BOLD signal fluctuations are highly correlated in distinct and long-ranged brain regions, indicating functional connectivity within specific and highly organized neuroanatomical networks. Functional connectivity studies have also demonstrated a high degree of spatial correlation between rs-fMRI functional brain connectivity and those studied during a hypercapnia challenge. Interestingly, recent research suggests that rs-BOLD signal may be impaired in patients in whom task-based increases in fMRI signals are reduced or absent due to NVU. Therefore, alterations in functional brain connectivity studied with rs-fMRI might provide insights into the presence of NVU as studied with CVR during hypercapnia. Such findings would be of interest in clinical practice as they could avoid the need for CVR-mapping with a hypercapnia challenge.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06797661,imaging; surgery,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

The brain is separated from the rest of the blood stream by the blood-brain barrier. This is like a filter that protects the brain. But is also a challenge when medicines need to get into the brain. Researchers want to give the new drug LB100 to people before brain tumor surgery. They will measure how much LB100 is in the blood and how much gets into the brain. This may help with the use of LB100 to treat brain tumors in the future.

Objective:

To see if LB100 can pass into the brain.

Eligibility:

People at least 18 years old with a brain tumor that requires surgery.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Physical exam

Medical history

Participants will have their brain surgery at the Clinical Center.

Participants will get a dose of the study drug through a plastic tube in a vein for 2 hours during surgery.

Participants will have blood taken 7 times in the 8 hours after getting the study drug.

Tumor samples will be taken during surgery.

Participants will have a heart test after getting the study drug. Sticky pads on the skin will measure electrical activity of the heart.

* Primary gliomas are an incurable disease in spite of aggressive multimodality therapy consisting of craniotomy, irradiation, and chemotherapy. Therapeutic options for patients with recurrent glioma are limited, and there is an unmet need to identify more effective agents.
* LB100, a water-soluble small molecule novel protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, was commercially developed through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) based on our previous intramural research. This compound has shown to be effective in a variety of cancer types in both in vitro and in vivo models. Preclinical studies indicate LB100 has in vitro and in vivo activity as a single agent as well as potentiating the effect of cytotoxic agents including temozolomide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, and ionizing radiation. LB100 is active in combination with temozolomide or doxorubicin against xenografts of glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, breast cancer, fibrosarcoma, and melanoma.
* A complete phase I study of LB100 has established its safety and the recommended phase II dose (2.33 mg/m\^2, daily for three days every 3 weeks).
* Although it is a polar compound, rodent studies suggest LB100 has activity in the brain.
* Whether LB100 can across the human blood brain barrier (BBB), and at what concentration relative to the plasma level is not known. Characterizing these parameters is important because:

  * 1) Our ongoing in vitro studies indicate that LB100 has distinct mechanisms of action at different drug concentrations (e.g., nM versus uM);
  * 2) There are other brain tumors lacking effective medical therapies but without a BBB. Characterizing the LB100 BBB penetration profile will assist in defining its optimal clinical indication.

Objective:

-To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of LB100 in glioma tumor tissues.

Eligibility:

* Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma and grades II-III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.
* A clear clinical indication for another surgical resection must be present.
* Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.
* Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60%.
* Patients must have adequate organ function.

Design:

* This is a two stage Phase II, open label, single institution study to determine the PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of LB100.
* The dose (established from a Phase I study) will be 2.33 mg/m\^2 delivered intravenously over 2 hours.
* PK and PD effect of LB100 treated tissues will only be evaluated with pathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor. Resected material demonstrating chemoradiation treatment effect or inflammatory response will not be included in the analysis.
* PK will be determined by quantitating LB100 in tumor tissues removed at various time points.
* The primary endpoint is PK response, defined as a binary variable indicating the presence/absence of LB100 in tumor tissues.
* PD effect is defined as statistically significant elevation of phospho-proteins in treated tumor tissues compared to untreated glioma specimens. Untreated inter-patient baseline variance and standard deviation (SD) will be calculated. Post-treatment PD effect difference greater than 2.5 times the baseline SD is statistically significant at the .05 significance level. Due to relatively small sample size, t-distribution is to be used to calculate the cutoff defining the PD response.
* Up to 25 patients may be enrolled to obtain 8 evaluable subjects. A two-stage design will be used. Five patients will be initially treated. If at least one of five demonstrates PK activity, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled. PK effect will be declared to be significant if at least 2 of the 8 patients demonstrate a PK response (presence of LB100 in tumor tissue).",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03027388,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

The study will include 3 treatment arms (up to n=12 evaluable patients per arm) and will be conducted at single site in Poland.

Patients with GBM will be randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio into one of 3 treatment arms:

Once qualified to the study patients will be randomized to one of the treatment arms. Then patients randomized to treatment arm 1 and 2 will receive first dose of neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab on day 4 and day 18 (200mg each). An immuno-PET scan for these arm 1 and 2 patients will be performed on day 29 and 30. Up to 72 hours after last immuno-PET scan all patients will undergo tumor resection.

After completion of radiotherapy the chemotherapy will continue for six cycles of 28 days with 150-200mg/m2 Temozolomide on days 1-5 of each cycle. In addition, patients randomized to arm 1 will receive 16 cycles of 21 days with Pembrolizumab treatment in adjuvant setting of 200mg/cycle.

During treatment period all patients will be assessed every three months and MRI will be performed in order to evaluate disease status/response.

After EOT patient's follow up period will continue for up to 3 years from initial resection with MRI assessment every 3 months.

If progression/relapse is identified, patients will undergo a tumor resection or biopsy within 48 hours thereafter.

All patients will then stay in follow up until the end of three years follow up period or death from any cause.

The evaluation of safety, tolerability, and quality-of-life (QoL) will be based on adverse event reporting criteria (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events - CTCAE/WHO Classification of Diseases - ICD10), ECOG status assessment, KPS assessment, EORTC - QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-BN20 scale.

Clinical assessment will be based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO). For patients treated with immunotherapy beyond onset of objective disease progression, the iRANO scale will be used within first 6 months of immunotherapy.

The hypothesis is based on the assumption that time to progression will be doubled in the treatment group.","Vaccination represents a success story in modern medicine and its principles have been found to be valid in different species, at least in the case of infectious diseases. As of today, there is little reason to believe that this would not be true in the case of tumours. It is now generally acknowledged that human tumours carry a mutational antigenic (non-self) repertoire of immunogenic potential that may be a suitable target for antitumour immune therapy. During the last years accumulating evidence from mouse experiments indicates that one can immunise prophylactically against cancers as effectively as against an infectious agent. However, in contrast to most experimental mouse tumour models, human tumours have in general been within their host for a long time and thus had the opportunity to influence their microenvironment and the larger immunological environment. Antigens capable of mediating specific rejection were found in human as well as in mouse tumours.

Many of the clinical trials using dendritic cell (DC) -based cancer vaccination techniques were designed for the treatment of melanoma. Other important diseases in which DC-based cancer vaccination was studied include prostate cancer, B cell lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, glioma and glioblastoma, breast and ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and selected solid paediatric tumours. In most of these trials some in vivo and/or in vitro evidence for the generation of anti-tumour immunity was found and even complete or partial remission of the tumour was observed in selected cases. The first phase III trial demonstrating the efficacy of DC cancer vaccination for the treatment of prostate cancer was reported recently (www.dendreon.com). Also patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme appear to benefit from DC cancer immune therapy. The side effects observed in DC cancer vaccinations were usually described to be mild and not limiting the application.

We developed a DC cancer vaccine technology, Trivax, advancing the design of DC cancer immune therapy in one critical aspect. It is the first such vaccine that is enable for releasing the immune modulatory cytokine interleukin (IL) -12. Trivax is comprised of IL-12 secreting DCs and a mixture of protein tumour antigens derived from the individual patient's tumour cells. No synthetic tumour antigen component is involved. Both components of Trivax are derived from the individual patient and are used for the treatment of only this patient. Trivax therefore represents a fully individualised somatic cell therapy medicine. Trimed's early clinical evaluations in patients suffering from kidney cancer, prostate cancer, bone tumours, and malignancies of childhood have confirmed the safety and the feasibility of the Trivax technology.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (ICD-O M9440/3) is the most malignant astrocytic tumour, composed of poorly differentiated neoplastic astrocytes. Histopathological features include cellular polymorphism, nuclear atypia, brisk mitotic activity, vascular thrombosis, micro-vascular proliferation and necrosis. GBM typically affects patients of various age beginning in childhood and up to high age. It is preferentially located in the cerebral hemispheres. GBM may develop from diffuse astrocytomas WHO grade II or anaplastic astrocytomas (secondary GBM), but more frequently, they manifest after a short clinical history de novo, without evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion (primary GBM). In spite of modern oncological treatment, the prognosis of GBM remains dismal, with a median survival of little over 1 year.

GBM-Vax is a randomised, open-label, 2-arm, multi-centre, phase II clinical study with both groups undergoing surgery and receiving standard therapy with Temozolomide and radiotherapy; and the treatment group that in addition to the standard therapy receives cancer immune therapy with Trivax. Our aim is to extend therapy options presently including surgery, irradiation and Temozolomide with DC cancer vaccination to improve the poor prognosis of patients with GBM.

Primary objective

• Progression free survival measured as percentage of non-progressive patients with newly diagnosed GBM 12 months after a post-operative MRI scan treated according to the current standard (surgical resection, irradiation, oral chemo-therapy with Temozolomide), and Trivax, an autologous DC cancer vaccine charged with autologous tumour protein, as add-on therapy (group A), in comparison to patients receiving standard treatment without Trivax (group B).

Secondary objectives

* Progression free survival measured as percentage of non-progressive patients with newly diagnosed GBM 18 and 24 months after a post-operative MRI scan receiving standard treatment and Trivax as add-on therapy (group A), in comparison to patients receiving standard treatment without Trivax (group B).
* Extension of overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM receiving standard treatment and Trivax as add-on therapy, in comparison to patients receiving standard treatment without Trivax.
* Quality of life in patients treated with Trivax as an add-on therapy using ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status compared to qual-ity of life of patients receiving standard therapy (for study patients older 18 years).

Number of subjects In total, 56 patients will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of 2 arms and at least 28 patients should be randomly assigned to one of the two arms. It is expected to recruit the study patients within a period of one year. Randomisation is based on stratification according to study sites at a 1:1 ratio. Patients younger than 18 years will not be randomised but will all receive add-on therapy with Trivax. We feel that it would be not just to expect from children to understand and accept that there is a new treatment available but only every second patient will receive it. Obviously, patients younger than 18 years will not be analysed together with adult patients in the context of the study; and paediatric patients will not count towards the recruiting number of 2 x 28. Thus, the results obtained in paediatric GBM patients will not influence the outcome of the study in patients older than 18 years.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01213407,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; pediatric,Mixed,Primary,Surgery

The combined maintenance treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent by the patient, or up to a maximum of 1 year of treatments. After disease progression or the end of maintenance phase, is foreseen a one-year follow-up phase for each subject.

Primary objectives are clinical activity and safety of the study treatment. Secondary objectives are the evaluation of the prognostic role of the positive Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test after at least four vaccine administrations, the OS and the immunological efficacy of the study treatment. A series of exploratory objectives will be also assessed on samples from patients who participate to this optional part of the trial.

After temozolomide rechallenge or combination with irinotecan, the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6%) of recurrent glioblastoma was about 21%. After treatment with irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen, the PFS-6% of recurrent lower-grade gliomas was 40%. The optimal chemotherapeutics of recurrent gliomas has yet to be determined.

Anti-angiogenesis is a promising therapeutic strategy. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) is the primary driver of angiogenesis in tumors. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF, is the prototypical anti-angiogenic drug and received accelerated approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Bevacizumab inproved the PFS-6% (36%), but had no effect on the overall survival (OS) (9.2 months). Moreover, the effects of bevacizumab are transient and most patients' tumors progress just after a median time of 3-5 months. Recombinant human endostatin (rh-ES) is an endogenous broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitor that has been shown to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy when combining with conventional chemotherapy agents in non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma.

In our previous study, we retrospectively analyzed the effect and toxicity of rh-ES when combined with temozolomide and irinotecan on adult recurrent disseminated glioblastoma. After combined treatment, PFS-6% was 23.3%; the median PFS and OS were 3.2 and 6.9 months, respectively, which were promising compared with that in other studies. Once patients get radiographic remission in a short time (4 months), they may get a long PFS.The combined regimen did not reduce the sensitivity of tumor to bevacizumab. After tumor progression from the combined chemotherapy, bevacizumab usage could help to prolong the survival time (5.1 months versus 2.4 months). Moreover, the toxicities of the combination therapy in this study were manageable.

On the basis of prior clinical experience, we carry out this prospective trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of the combination of rh-ES, temozolomide and irinotecan in patients with recurrent gliomas.",,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04267978,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Unclear
NCT05116137,The Impact of Resistance ExerciSe on Muscle Mass in GlioblaSToma Survivors (RESIST),ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,['NA'],INTERVENTIONAL,24,ESTIMATED,"Mary MacNeil, MD (Nova Scotia Health Authority); Scott Grandy, PhD (Dahousie University and Nova Scotia Health Authority)",3/1/2022,12/31/2025,12/31/2025,Nova Scotia Health Authority,Canadian Cancer Society (CCS),Glioblastoma Multiforme of Brain; Brain Cancer,Circuit-based resistance exercise (CRT),18 years,,ALL,"Glioblastoma patients are confronted with a debilitating disease associated with a low survival rate and poor quality of life. The goal of this study will be to reach a largely underrepresented population in the exercise literature and explore the role of a tailored circuit-based resistance training program on functional fitness (i.e., ability to carry out tasks of daily living) and associated health outcomes (e.g., quality of life) for GBM patients on active treatment.","PROBLEM: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain malignancy accounting for approximately 48% of all brain tumors. GBMs are highly vascular and can cause vasogenic brain edema and mass effect, which can worsen the neurologic symptoms associated with the disease. Corticosteroids (i.e., Dexamethasone; DEX) are the treatment of choice to reduce vasogenic edema and intercranial pressure associated with GBM. However, the use of steroids comes at a cost. High dose steroid therapy and/or long-term use results in muscle myopathy (i.e., muscle weakness) in 10-60% of GBM patients, significantly reducing functional ability as well as quality of life (QOL). Thus, adjuvant therapies are needed to help patients maintain their functional ability and QOL. There is a wealth of evidence to support the use of exercise as an adjuvant therapy to improve functional ability as well as help manage treatment-related symptoms. Resistance training (RT) has been shown to increase muscle mass, strength, and functional ability in aging adults and several cancer populations. While limited, studies in GBM have shown that exercise is safe and feasible for this population and that it can improve functional performance. However, no specific research has been performed to determine whether RT can be successfully used in GBM to prevent or reduce steroid induced muscle myopathy. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to establish whether an individualized circuit-based RT program will improve functional fitness for patients on active treatment and receiving steroids.

METHODS: This is a two-armed randomized control trial with repeated measures. Thirty-eight adult (18+ years) patients diagnosed with either primary or secondary GBM who are scheduled to receive standard radiation and concurrent adjuvant Temozolomide chemotherapy post-surgical debulking as well as received any dose of DEX will be recruited through the neuro-oncology clinic and the QEII Cancer Center. Patients will be randomly allocated to a standard of care group (SOC) or SOC+RT group (EX). Those in the SOC group will be advised to maintain an active lifestyle for the 12-week intervention whereas those in the EX group will receive a personalized 12-week circuit-based RT program. This program will consist of 3-4 supervised RT sessions/wk. During each session participants will perform a RT program that is comprised of 3 circuits. Each circuit will include 3 sets of 3 different exercises. Each exercise set will be 1 minute in duration (20 seconds/exercise) with 1 minute of rest between sets. Initial exercise intensity will be light and will increase throughout the program based on the participant's progress. All exercise programs will be designed and supervised by a Clinical Exercise Physiologist (CEP). The primary outcome measure for the study is functional performance which will be assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery and hand grip strength. Secondary outcome measures will include body composition, aerobic fitness, physical activity levels, general health, QOL, fatigue, and cognitive function. All measures will be assessed pre/post-intervention. Safety and exercise adherence will be assessed throughout the study.

ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the population, accrual, program adherence and safety. Outcome data will be analyzed using an intention to treat approach. All participants will be entered into a mixed effects model with participant group assignment (EX, SOC) at randomization and timepoint (pre- and post-test) as fixed factors and participant entered as a random factor. Due to feasibility in recruiting participants in the allotted time, the study will not be fully powered to detect sex-based differences; however, effect sizes associated with the intervention will be calculated and presented separately for each sex.

SIGNIFICANCE: This study will demonstrate the not only is RT safe and feasible for those with GBM, but that it also significantly improves functional status by protecting against myopathy. This will help GBM patients maintain their independence which could lead to marked improvements in QOL.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05116137,surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

Since the pivotal trial evaluating the effect of temozolomide (TMZ), overall survival has not increased.

Treatment of GBM xenografts in vivo with chloroquine (CQ), an antimalarial agent, has been shown to reduce the hypoxic fraction and sensitizes tumors to radiation. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification or mutation is regularly observed GBM and is thought to be a major contributor to radioresistance. The most common EGFR mutation in GBM (EGFRvIII) is present in 50-60% of patients whose tumor shows amplification of EGFR. EGFR provides cells with a survival advantage through autophagy when exposed to stresses such as hypoxia and nutrient starvation. This effect is even more pronounced in EGFRvIII overexpressing tumors. Previously, the potential effect CQ has been demonstrated in a small randomized controlled trial in GBM treated with radiotherapy and carmustine, which showed a trend towards increased overall survival. However, as the intracellular effects of chloroquine are dose-dependent the maximum tolerated dose for CQ in combination with concurrent radiotherapy with daily temozolomide needs to be established.","This trial has been designed as an open label, single center combination phase I trial. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for chloroquine (CQ) in combination with concurrent radiotherapy with daily temozolomide in patients with a newly diagnosed GBM.

Eligible patients will receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to standard protocol for newly diagnosed GBM. This consists of 33 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy to the tumor and surrounding margin in combination with TMZ 75 mg/m² per os daily (po qd) and six adjuvant cycles of TMZ 150 - 200 mg/m² po qd. Treatment will be combined with daily intake of escalating doses of chloroquine. Chloroquine will start with week before the start of radiotherapy and end on the last day of radiotherapy.

The rate of subject entry and escalation to the next dose level will depend upon assessment of the safety profile of patients entered at the previous dose level. Toxicity will be evaluated according to the NCI common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.

The 3 + 3 cohort method is used. A minimum of three patients will be entered at each dose level. All three will be followed during the concomitant radiotherapy and a 4 week observation period before escalation to the next dose level.

The start dose is 200mg chloroquine daily.

NCT01238237,Phase I Trial of Super-Selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion of Cetuximab (Erbitux) for Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Glioblastoma Multiforme and Anaplastic Astrocytoma,COMPLETED,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,15,ACTUAL,"John Boockvar, MD (Feinstein Institute for Medical Research)",2009-12,2016-01,2016-01,Northwell Health,,Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM); ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA (AOA); GBM; Anaplastic Astrocytoma,Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion of Cetuximab,18 years,,ALL,"The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. Initial therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. All patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) is a technique that can effectively increase the concentration of drug delivered to the brain while sparing the body of systemic side effects. One currently used drug called, Cetuximab (Erbitux) has been shown to be active in human brain tumors but its actual CNS penetration is unknown. This phase I clinical research trial will test the hypothesis that Cetuximab can be safely used by direct intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion up to a dose of 500mg/m2 to ultimately enhance survival of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM/AA. By achieving the aims of this study the investigators will determine the the toxicity profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SIACI Cetuximab. The investigators expect that this study will provide important information regarding the utility of SIACI Cetuximab therapy for malignant glioma, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to the investigators patients in the near future.","There is no current standard of care for recurring GBM after patients receive Bevacizumab (Avastin) intravenously (IV) at 10mg/kg with CPT-11 (Irinotecan). At that point, these patients are deemed treatment failures and are given another experimental treatment. Because of the blood brain barrier (BBB) where IV drugs do not penetrate the blood vessel walls well to get into the brain, no one knows for sure if these IV drugs actually get into the brain after infusion. Previous studies have shown that if you want to increase your penetration of drug to the brain, that intra-carotid artery (intraarterial) delivery is superior to standard intravenous delivery. Previous techniques using intraarterial (intracarotid) infusion still were non-selective as drug delivery still went to all blood vessels in the brain, so patients still had significant adverse events, such as blindness. Newer techniques in interventional neuroradiology have allowed for a more selective delivery of catheters higher up into the arterial tree where agents such as chemotherapies, can be delivered without the risk of adverse affects such as blindness. In fact, studies here at Cornell have developed very new and exciting super selective intraarterial delivery treatments for Retinoblastoma, eye tumors with little toxicity and a clinical trial of intraarterial delivery of Avastin is currently underway for GBM. Therefore, this trial will ask one simple question: Is it safe to deliver a dose of Cetuximab intraarterially using these super selective delivery techniques instead of the standard intravenous route of administration? This should not only increase the amount of drug that gets to the tumor but also spare the patient any adverse effects from a less selective delivery. Prior to that single dose of intraarterial Cetuximab, the patient will also receive a dose of mannitol that opens up the blood brain barrier to improve delivery of the agent to the brain. After that single dose of Mannitol and Cetuximab intraarterially, the patient will be evaluated for 4 weeks to assess for toxicity. After this point, the patient is done with the ""experimental"" aspects of the protocol. If no toxicity at this point, then the patient will go on and get their chosen chemotherapy as determined by their treating oncologist. In summary, this is a Phase I trial that is designed to test the safety of a single dose of intraarterial delivery of Mannitol and Cetuximab , prior to starting the patients next round of chosen chemotherapy

To summarize:

Current Standard of Care Therapy : None

Experimental portion of this proposal:

Day 0: Intraarterial Mannitol to open the blood brain barrier followed by Intraarterial Cetuximab single dose (starting at 100mg/m2 and up to 500mg/m2)

Therefore the experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:

1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol 25%; 3-10 mL/s for 30seconds) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.
2. To add a single intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of the Cetuximab for patients with recurring or relapsing high grade glioma. After a one cycle observation period to assess for toxicity from the IA infusion, the subject will receive a regimen of chemotherapy to be decided by their treating oncologist The dose escalation algorithm is as follows: We will use a single intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion of Cetuximab, starting at a dose of 100mg/m2 in the first three patients. Assuming no dose limiting toxicity during the next 28 days after the infusion, the patient will then begin their standard chemotherapy regimen which is to be determined by their treating oncologist. The doses will be escalated from 100, to 200, 300, 400 and finally 500mg/m2 in this Phase I trial.

Both hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity from the IA infusion of Cetuximab will be determined and scored according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Monitoring will also include an MRI of the brain at 4 weeks post infusion.

Most patients with GBM are also monitored every two months with serial history, neurological and physical examinations together with serial blood counts, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and chemistries. In addition, most patients with GBM have an MRI performed every two cycles or approximately every two months to assess for tumor progression. .

Since this is a Phase I trial, response is not a primary endpoint of the trial. However, we will evaluate response to the one time IA Cetuximab therapy with a a MRI with the injection of contrast about 4 weeks after infusion. Follow-up of all patients in the trial regardless of the chemotherapy regimen they try after the IA Cetuximab therapy will continue until disease progression or death. Survival will be measured from the time of the dose of IA Cetuximab®. We expect patients in the trial to monitored for 12 months.

These methods include oral contraceptives, contraceptive shots, and barrier methods, such as condom use, sponges, and diaphragms. Fertile males are required to use these barrier methods.

The patient may be responsible for any additional costs associated with enrollment in the trial.

The FET-PET examination can be performed using the dual-time point aqusition of FET for exact treatment planning. It has also been proven that using the dual FET-PET method, it is possible to obtain a precise image of the glioblastoma infiltration corresponding to the location and shape of the recurrence, and the tumor volumes in dual FET-PET are significantly larger than in MRI. Moreover, tumor defined in dual FET-PET is different than that of the tumor defined in single FET-PET acquisition.

Using of dual FET-PET images for treatment planning allow to reduce volumes of healthy tissue irradiated. Dose-intensification proposed in the study using simultaneous in-field boost allows the dose escalation without increasing the overall treatment time.

Study Design:

At the first dose level of 2 GBq, 131I-IPA will be administered in one of three different dosing regimens:

* Single dose regimen (1f group): Full 131I-IPA activity (2.0 GBq at the 2 GBq dose level) will be administered 1- 3 days prior to 1st XRT as a single injection.
* Fractionated dose regimen (3f - parallel group): 131I-IPA activity will be administered in 3 fractions corresponding to ⅓ full dose activity (0.67 GBq for the 2.0 GBq dose level). The 1st fraction of 131I-IPA will be administered as above, 1- 3 days prior to

  1st XRT. The 2nd and 3rd 131I-IPA fractions will be administered after 5-9 XRT fractions (subject to investigator's discretion and day of IMP administration) following the previous 131I-IPA fraction. The remainder of XRT fractions will be given following the 3rd 131I-IPA fraction.
* Fractionated dose regimen (3f - sequential group): 131I-IPA activity will be administered in 3 fractions corresponding to ⅓ full dose activity (0.67 GBq for the 2.0 GBq dose level). The 1st fraction of 131I-IPA will be administered as above 1- 3 days prior to 1st XRT. The 2nd 131I-IPA fraction will be administered after all 18 XRT fractions have been completed, and the 3rd 131I-IPA fraction will be administered 1 week after the 2nd 131I-IPA fraction. The 2nd and 3rd 131I-IPA injections should be given on the same day of the week, and some hours after administration of the respective XRT dose of that day. The day of IMP administration is subject to change at investigator's discretion. The three different treatment groups at the first (2.0 GBq) dose level (131I-IPA single dose 1f and 131I-IPA fractionated dose either 3f parallel or 3f sequential) will be recruited in parallel, as appropriate. Patients will be allocated to one of the three IPA dosing regimens. N=3 patients will be enrolled for each of the three treatment schedules. A 10th patient can be added to any of the three groups, in order to corroborate evidence for possible differences in safety and efficacy.

Patients at the entry dose level of 2 GBq will undergo 131I-IPA brain SPECT for tumour dosimetry (performed in all patients), whole body planar imaging for determination of biodistribution and whole body safety dosimetry. In addition, these patients will be comparatively assessed for possible differences in safety and/or efficacy among the different dosing regimens.

Dose escalation beyond 2 GBq will be made using the fractionated dosing regimen only, unless the outcome of the 2 GBq dose level suggests otherwise. The best treatment schedule (3f parallel or 3f sequential, see above) for higher doses shall be selected after completion of the 2 GBq dose level.

Dose escalation will be made in steps of 2.0 GBq, i.e. 4.0 (3\*1.33 GBq), 6.0 GBq (3\*2.0 GBq), up to 8.0 GBq (3\*2.67 GBq) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, using cohorts of N=3 patients.

If MTD has not been reached at 8.0 GBq, dose escalation may further proceed, increasing the dose fractions to a total dose 131I- IPA greater than 8 GBq using cohorts of N=3 as follows: 10 GBq, 3f (i.e. 3\*3.33 GBq); 12 GBq, 3f (i.e. 3\*4 GBq), etc., until MTD is reached or until a satisfactory anti-neoplastic efficacy is observed.

For assessment of possible anti-neoplastic effects during dose escalation, only amino acid-based molecular imaging (preferably 18F-FET-PET) will be used, which allows assessment of treatment-induced changes based on a single post-therapeutic imaging study.

MTD is defined as the dose level, inducing dose limiting toxicity (DLT), in not more than 1/6 of the subjects receiving such dose. MTD will be determined on day 45 from the first IPA injection. DLT is defined as grade 4 neurotoxicity or any other grade 4 toxicity according to NCI-CTC (version 4.03). If DLT is observed in 1 subject of a cohort, 3 additional patients will be treated at the same dose level, under which such toxicity occurred. If one or more of these patients (i.e. 2/4, 2/5 or 2/6) experience grade 4 toxicity, MTD will have been exceeded for the respective dose level. In such a case, 3 additional patients will be treated at the preceding dose level. Therapy-induced early necrosis, (also termed pseudo-progression, which has been associated with improved survival will not be classified as DLT if asymptomatic, or if symptomatic and at least partially reversible within three months with or without therapy. Disease progression/PsPD will be diagnosed according to the current RANO criteria (2017).

The highest dose under which no more than 1/6 of the patients experience DLT will be declared the MTD level. Safety, tolerability and evidence of anti-tumour effects will be compared between all dose levels, in order to identify a most suitable dose level (MSDL) for the phase II part. The MSDL will not necessarily be identical to the MTD, but might be selected by jointly considering efficacy, safety and radiation protection aspects. The identification of the MSDL will be made by a Drug Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), based on an integrated review of efficacy and safety from the first part. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the first part results, the DSMB will make a conclusion regarding safety and efficacy, and recommend to the sponsor a dosing strategy and dose level (MSDL) for the phase II part, if merited. Prior to initiating phase II, the sponsor commits to submit a substantial amendment, containing a summary of the phase I results to the Austrian BASG, other competent authorities, and the responsible Ethics Committee, as appropriate.

Upon establishment of the MSDL, 12-22 further patients will be treated at the MSDL (Phase II). If unequivocal evidence of efficacy is observed, another 10 patients shall be included in the phase II part. It is planned to include approximately 34 (22+12) patients with recurrent GBM with the option to extend phase II study by another 10 patients if the results are encouraging (22+22 patients).",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03849105,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary tumor of the central nervous system characterized by an extremely severe prognosis with a median survival of 14-16 months from diagnosis. Patients affected by high-grade gliomas are treated with a combination of radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. To date, the efficacy of the treatment is assessed through MRI which shows evidence of early radiological progression in up to 50% of all patients. Importantly, signs of tumor progression on MRI images may actually represent pseudoprogression in up to 64% of cases meaning that within 6 months from the end of the radiation treatment 20-30% of patients show increased contrast enhancement that resolves on subsequent MRI scans without changes in the treatment. Pseudoprogression is a phenomenon likely related to inflammation and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) caused by radiation and by the concurrent temozolomide treatment. Being a self-resolving consequence of the therapy rather than a sign of tumor growth, mistaking pseudoprogression for real progression leads to premature discontinuation of therapy and inappropriate evaluation of progression free survival and response rate in clinical trials impairing clinical practice.

Therefore, the differentiation of pseudoprogression from true progression is both a challenge in everyday clinical activity and a relevant problem in clinical trials and research.

A major limitation to the development and assessment of efficacy of current and new therapies in the setting of brain tumors, both at preclinical and clinical levels, however, is the lack of reliable trial endpoints.

A combination of advanced imaging methods, MRI and PET, with innovative techniques investigating cancer-specific biology will allow a holistic characterization of the tumor from multiple aspects crucial to enable a personalized diagnostic and therapeutical approach.

Objective

The main goal of the project is the development and validation of imaging markers, MRI and PET, plasma biomarkers, and/or cell markers that could support clinicians and researchers in differentiating pseudoprogression from true tumor progression in routine clinical activities and clinical trials in patients affected by GBM.

Main trial endpoints

The primary endpoint of the study is the elaboration of predictive models (evaluation of specificity and sensitivity) using imaging advanced biomarkers, PET and MRI, biological serum markers, and cancer cell derived makers to differentiate tumor pseudoprogression or real progression in patients affected by GBM who underwent therapeutical protocol as per treating physicians' indications (Stupp or hypofractionated RT).

Secondary trial endpoints

We aim to establish an in vivo murine model of pseudoprogression by orthotopic transplantation of GSCs derived from thirty-five patient subjected to subsequent treatment with irradiation and temozolomide administration.

Trial design

This is a pilot prospective interventional clinical trial using a novel 18F-GE-180 PET radio-metabolic marker (AxMP) and MRI with advanced sequences with no modification of standard of care treatment and additional diagnostic procedures that do not pose more than minimal additional risk or burden to the subjects compared to normal clinical practice. The trial will enroll 75 patients in 42 months and will be concluded in 60 months.

Trial population

The trial will prospectively enroll 75 patients affected by isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (IDH)-wild type Glioblastoma, with an age above 18 years old , who will undergo standard of care treatment.

Interventions

Before surgery and starting the standard treatment with RT and chemotherapy, all subjects will undergo baseline MRI and 18F-GE-180 PET imaging, and blood withdrawal for evaluation of plasma biomarkers of inflammation, circulating microvesicles, and RNA. MRI exams will then be performed as per standard practice of care every 3 months and in case of clinical deterioration suggesting possible disease recurrence/progression. A second PET-scan along with plasma sample collection will be performed only in case of MRI evidence of either suspected tumor progression or pseudoprogression. In case of MRI evidence of an increase in tumor size (either suspected true tumor progression or pseudoprogression), as for standard of care, the Institutional Multidisciplinary Brain Tumor Board (composed of neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, neuroradiologists, radiotherapists) will discuss each patient for determining clinical indication and feasibility of second surgery. In those patients in whom second surgery is not indicated, a stereotactic biopsy will be considered if feasible, safe, and clinically useful. If a stereotactic biopsy is not feasible and safe, a 3-month follow-up will be planned before a change in treatment. When available, pathology will be considered as the gold standard for differentiation pseudoprogression from true tumor progression. In all other subjects, follow-up and overall survival data will be evaluated for this differentiation. In all the subjects, overall survival data will be also recorded for statistical analyses.

Cancer Stem Cells /CSC) will be collected form 35 patients and Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) from 10 patients for the creation of a vitro and in vivo murine model.

Ethical considerations relating to the clinical trial including the expected benefit to the individual subject or group of patients represented by the trial subjects as well as the nature and extent of burden and risks This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guideline as well as international and national legal and regulatory requirements.

All study participants will receive the standards of care for GBM. The additional diagnostic procedures (PET scan with a novel tracer and high resolution 3 Tesla scanner MRI) do not entail specific risks for the patient. At every time point (at least before surgery, before RT and in case of pseudoprogression) additional blood samples for the determinations of markers of inflammation and the isolation of circulating microvesicles and RNA will be collected from the patients. Glioblastoma stem cells will be isolated from the tumoral mass excised during glioblastoma surgery in 35 patients; hematopoietic stem cells will be obtained from 10 consenting patients at the time of surgery by aspiration of 30-40ml of bone marrow from the iliac crests, as per standard clinical practice.

As discussed above it seems unlikely that patient outcomes will be significantly improved with radiation dose escalation given at the time of the EBRT boost. However, as most failures are local, improving LC could potentially improve the OS of patients. To do this, we propose a shift in the traditional radiation paradigm. This study will assess the feasibility and tolerability of adding GT radiation therapy as an upfront boost at the time of maximum safe resection, along with the backbone of the current standard of care approach, concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide +/- TTF, for patients with newly diagnosed GBM. GT, a novel brain brachytherapy device utilizing Cs-131 embedded in bioresorbable collagen tiles, offers a more sophisticated carrier and a shorter half-life radioisotope, Cs-131. Use of this device allows for radiation initiation at an earlier time point and a more rapid dose delivery and possibly more effective tumor control particularly for rapidly proliferating tumors such as GBM. Two prospective studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of re-irradiation with GT in patients with recurrent GBM. The overarching goal of this single-arm, open label phase 4 study is to determine the feasibility and tolerability of treating patients with GammaTile in combination with the Stupp Protocol and how to proceed with testing this treatment in a future, larger, randomized clinical study. The aims of the study are to demonstrate that the use of GammaTile at the time of surgery is well tolerated and does not delay the start of the Stupp protocol. Efficacy outcomes (e.g., LC, OS, PFS) will also be described.","This study seeks to explore if GT, given its unique radiobiological and physical characteristics, may permit safe dose escalation and intensification and thereby provide a benefit to newly diagnosed GBM patients in terms of OS and LC when incorporated into the framework of the Stupp protocol. In this study, GT is utilized as an upfront boost at the time of maximum safe resection and dosimetrically integrated into what is otherwise standard of care therapy.

Patients in this study will receive doses from two different forms of radiation treatment, initially from Cs-131 BT with GT and subsequently from fractionated EBRT. In order to ensure both patient safety and adequacy of treatment, we have chosen to stipulate and evaluate the coverage of the tumor volumes and OARs using the doses combined from both these treatments. The intention is that with this methodology the doses received by the target volumes and relevant OARs from the implanted Cs-131 will be accounted for during EBRT treatment planning. This dose combination, accomplished using radiobiological modeling, is frequently undertaken in breast, prostate, and gynecological malignancies. To provide oversight and planning feedback, the first three patients enrolled at each site will undergo review by the Clinical Oversight Committee (COC) at two points for each patient, once after the GT implant, and before starting EBRT treatment.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05342883,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Radiation is targeted to the visible residual tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images plus a large margin of 15 to 30 mm to account for possible cancer cells outside the visible tumor and for potential growth or shifts in tumor position throughout the prolonged RT course. Standard RT uses MRI to create a reference plan (with large margins) and treats that same volume every day. This exposes a large amount of healthy brain tissue to radiation leading to toxicity and reduced quality of life.

A new technology, the MR-Linac, combines an MRI scanner and a Linac (radiation delivery machine) into one unit. This allows for ""adaptive"" RT by obtaining an updated MRI scan each day just prior to treatment, adapting the RT plan to take into account any changes in the tumor or the patient's anatomy on that given day.

NCT00995007,A Randomized Phase II Trial of Vandetanib (ZD6474) in Combination With Carboplatin Versus Carboplatin Alone Followed by Vandetanib Alone in Adults With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas,COMPLETED,['PHASE2'],INTERVENTIONAL,112,ACTUAL,"Katherine E Warren, M.D. (National Cancer Institute (NCI))",2009-09,2015-12,2015-06,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,Glioblastoma Multiforme; Gliosarcoma; Anaplastic Astrocytoma; Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma; Anaplastic Mixed Oligoastrocytoma,ZD6474 (Vandetanib); Carboplatin,18 years,100 years,ALL,"Background:

* Growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) provides many tumors, including brain tumors, with needed nutrients and oxygen for cancer cells to survive. One possible treatment for different kinds of cancer involves treatment with drugs that slow or stop angiogenesis and prevent further tumor growth.
* Vandetanib is an oral medication known to block angiogenesis and has shown significant antitumor activity in laboratory and animal studies. Vandetanib appears to be well tolerated by patients at specific daily doses.
* Carboplatin is a drug that interrupts division of cancer cells and has been shown to be a useful drug in treatment of tumors known as gliomas. It is a useful drug for treating brain tumors, but researchers are interested in gathering more information about how it works as a treatment for patients who have not responded to initial surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.

Objective:

- To determine the safety and effectiveness of vandetanib and carboplatin, given together or sequentially, against recurrent high-grade gliomas.

Eligibility:

- Adults diagnosed with a malignant glioma who have received standard treatments that no longer appear to be effective.

Design:

* Patients will be assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 patients (combination group) will receive oral vandetanib for 28 days and intravenous (IV) carboplatin (once at the beginning of the 28-day cycle). Group 2 patients (sequential group) will receive IV carboplatin alone (once at the beginning of the 28-day cycle) and then oral vandetanib (300 mg daily) for 28 days if the tumor grows or the patient develops unacceptable carboplatin toxicity.
* Treatment will continue in 28-day cycles for 1 year for both groups.
* Patients will undergo a number of tests and procedures during the treatment cycle, including physical examinations, routine laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
* At the end of 1 year of treatment, patients will be reevaluated for possible continuation of drug therapy.","Background:

In vivo experiments have documented the ability of vandetanib (ZD6474) to inhibit tumor growth in various preclinical tumor models. Given the pronounced neovasculature associated with malignant gliomas, and abundant published data demonstrating the dependence of glioma growth on the maintenance and proliferation of this neovasculature, vandetanib represents a potentially promising new therapeutic approach to these otherwise refractory tumors. Phase II data of vandetanib for recurrent glioblastomas conducted at the National Institutes of Health showed promising activity but responses were usually short-lasting.

Carboplatin has shown activity as monotherapy in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas in adults and preclinical data generated at Dr. Fines' laboratory demonstrate additive anti-glioma activity with vandetanib. The safety profile of carboplatin and the preclinical and clinical data supports its use in combination with vandetanib in patients with malignant gliomas.

Vandetanib is also an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor and it has been demonstrated that the presence of the EGFRvIII mutant and/or the presence of an intact phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and non-phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT) predict for a higher likelihood of response to the EGFR inhibitors Tarceva and Iressa.

Objectives:

To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of vandetanib in combination with carboplatin and single agent carboplatin and to collect information regarding the spectrum of toxicities.

To determine if the presence of the EGFRvIII mutant and/or the presence of an intact PTEN and non-phosphorylated AKT predict for a higher likelihood of response to vandetanib.

Eligibility:

Patients with histologically proven malignant glioma are eligible for this study.

Design:

Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of two groups. Patients in group one will be treated with vandetanib (300 mg daily for patients not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and 400 mg daily for patients on EIAEDs) and with carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve at steady-state \[area under curve (AUC)\], 6mg/mL x min) once every 4-week cycle (combination group). Patients in group two will receive carboplatin alone (AUC 6mg/mL x min) once every 4-week cycle. Patients who develop tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity on carboplatin alone (group 2) can then receive single agent vandetanib (300 mg daily for patients not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and 400 mg daily for patients on EIAEDs) in 4-week cycles (sequential group). A total of 128 evaluable patients will be analyzed. The total accrual ceiling will allow for 74 patients to be enrolled in the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) stratum and 74 patients in the anaplastic gliomas (AG) stratum (total 148) to factor in replacing those patients who come off treatment prior to cycle 1.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00995007,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying high-dose chemotherapy or intermediate-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation to see how well it works compared to high-dose chemotherapy or intermediate-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and isotretinoin in treating young patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.","OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the event-free survival and overall survival of pediatric patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with a single course of high-dose carboplatin, etoposide, and thiotepa and autologous stem cell transplantation vs multiple courses of intermediate-dose carboplatin and thiotepa and autologous stem cell transplantation with or without isotretinoin.
* Compare the number of hospital days and time to engraftment in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the toxic death rate in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the tolerability of isotretinoin in patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to pathologic diagnosis (glioblastoma multiforme vs anaplastic astrocytoma vs other high-grade glioma).

* Chemotherapy and autologous stem cell reinfusion (ASCR): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

  * Arm I (high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR): Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days -8 to -6; thiotepa IV over 3 hours and etoposide IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -3; and filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow are reinfused on day 0.
  * Arm II (intermediate-dose chemotherapy and ASCR): Patients receive intermediate-dose chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV over 4 hours and thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days 1-2 and G-CSF IV or SC once daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover. Autologous PBSC or bone marrow are reinfused on day 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 3 courses.
* Maintenance therapy: After recovery from chemotherapy (approximately day 30 post-transplantation), all patients are further randomized to 1 of 2 maintenance arms.

  * Arm I: Patients receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 6 courses.
  * Arm II: Patients do not receive maintenance therapy. In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

This study will assess in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study the effects of chloroquine as adjuvant to the conventional therapy of Glioblastoma Multiforme.","ANTECEDENTS: We have shown experimentally a significant adjuvant effect of quinacrine (an analog of chloroquine) on cultured malignant glial cells and C6 implanted malignant glioma in Wistar rats. When quinacrine was added to the standard therapy with carmustine cell destruction and tumor diminution were higher than therapy with carmustine alone. Those results were published in Neurosurgery 2001; 49:969-973 (at that time the manuscript was ""in press"").

The present protocol started with a controlled, open-label clinical trial on 7 patients with GBM and 7 contemporary control patients. All patients received the same treatment of extensive surgery, carmustine therapy and irradiation at the standard doses as (as described in our previous report Surgical Neurology 2000; 53:157-162). Once selected to enter the study the patients were allocated alternatively in the chloroquine or the control group. Endpoint evaluation was settled as surviving time after the beginning of therapy and the end point follow-up was settled in survivors at two years after the beginning of treatment.

18 months after the beginning of the open trial it was observed that chloroquine treated patients had a longer survival and no adverse effects to chloroquine therapy were seen.

At that time it was decided to start the second part of the protocol designed as a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, ideal number of patients to be included was settled in 15 patients on each group.

The results of the 1st. phase of the study by the open-label trial were published in Neurosurgical Focus (http://www.aans.org/education/journal/neurosurgical/feb03/14-2-3.pdf) on February, 2003.

In order to corroborate the observations (at that time with a short follow-up) of the open trial the double-blind, a placebo-controlled study was initiated in October, 2000; the dose of chloroquine for the blind study was decided to be maintained in 150 mg daily for one year after the beginning of therapy.

The Research Committee was notified on the beginning and the design of this trial: 6,000 tablets of chloroquine 150 mg (Aralen) and 6,000 identical tablets of placebo were commercially purchased and sent to the laboratory of Dr. Roberto Medina at the National Polytechnic Institute (selected as monitor). 30 sets of 375 tablets each were separated (15 contained chloroquine and 15 placebo) in identical flasks, the assignment of treatments was randomly allocated; the codified treatments numbered 1-30 were then sent back to our Institute. The code was sealed and kept by the monitor until the end of the study. Patients included in the study were given the corresponding treatment in sequential order.

Criteria for inclusion of patients in the trial is detailed in methods of the manuscript submitted to the Annals of Internal Medicine Ms. # M0-1087 (pages 6-7).

Follow-up and statistical analysis: End-point evaluation was settled as time of death after the beginning of therapy. Follow-up for survivors was settled at 2 years after the beginning of treatment. Survival distributions were analyzed as a Kaplan-Meier plot and compared by the log rank test. Statistical analysis of demographic, clinical and imaging characteristics of patients was made by the t test for independent values.

After more than four years from the beginning of the study 26 patients from the originally decided goal number of 30 patients had completed at least two years of follow-up. At this time (January 2005) it was decided to open the code and proceed with the analysis of those patients, which turned out to be 13 chloroquine-treated and 13 placebo-treated patients. The last 4 patients (who were not included in the analysis) are currently under treatment but their follow-up will end next year (2 patients are received chloroquine and the other 2 placebo).

No patient initially selected refuse to enter the study, nor any patient included was lost at follow-up.

PET using \[18F\]-FMISO has been described to be useful for the non invasive assessment of hypoxia in cancer. The use of this radiotracer for brain tumours is very limited and there is no standard to acquire and quantify \[18F\]-FMISO uptake. So there is a need for a methodological evaluation of this PET tracer The purpose of this research is to define optimal parameters for acquisition and data exploitation to quantify \[18F\]-FMISO uptake and so predict clinical outcome in glioblastomas.

Low sensitivity to radiation of glioblastoma is partly caused by hypoxia. Hypoxia in tumours is not predicted by tumour size. Detecting and monitoring tissue oxygenation are of great interest to modify therapeutic strategies, including local dose escalation for radiotherapy or select chemotherapeutic agents with better impact in glioblastomas.

PET with appropriate radiotracers, especially \[18F\]-FMISO, enables non-invasive assessment of hypoxia. \[18F\]-FMISO only accumulates in viable hypoxic cells. So, it has been demonstrated that PET using 18F-FMISO is suitable to localize and quantify hypoxia. But there isn't any optimal acquisition protocol or standardized images quantification treatment. Thus, the interpretation of \[18F\]-FMISO PET images and the predictive value of \[18F\]-FMISO SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) remain unclear explaining the need of methodological approaches.","Hypoxia is one of the worst prognostic factors of clinical outcome in glioblastomas. Today, it is well admitted that hypoxia is heterogeneous, variable within different tumour types and varied spatially and temporally. Hypoxia induced proteomic and gene expression changes that lead to increase angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. So the hypoxic fraction in solid tumours reduces their sensitivity to conventional treatment modalities, modulating therapeutic response to ionizing radiation or certain chemotherapeutic agents. This is particularly important in glioblastomas. Hypoxic cells in solid tumours could influence local failure following radiotherapy and has been associated with malignant progression, loco regional spread and distant metastases and represents an increasing probability of recurrence.

Thus, the non-invasive determination and monitoring of the oxygenation status of tumours is of importance to classify patients' outcome and modify therapeutic strategies in those tumours. Actually the oxygenation status of individual tumours is not assessed routinely. Numerous different approaches have been used to identify hypoxia in tumours. Eppendorf oxygen probe measurements (pO2 histography) may be considered as a 'gold standard' for hypoxia in human malignancies. However, it is an invasive method being confined to superficial, well accessible tumours and requires many measures. PET using \[18F\]Fluoro-deoxyglucose (\[18F\]-FDG), allows non-invasive imaging of glucose metabolism and takes a growing place in cancer staging, but \[18F\]-FDG can't assess correctly the oxygenation status of tumours and is not suitable for brain tumor. PET with appropriate radiotracers enables non-invasive assessment of presence and distribution of hypoxia in tumours. Nitroimidazoles are a class of electron affinic molecules that were shown to accumulate in hypoxic cells in cultures and in vivo. \[18F\]-FMISO is the most frequently employed tracer; its intracellular retention is dependent on oxygen concentration. Consequently \[18F\]-FMISO has been used as a non-invasive technique for detection of hypoxia in human. Different authors have demonstrated that it is suitable to localize and quantify hypoxia. Thus, \[18F\]-FMISO PET has been studied to evaluate prognosis and predict treatment response. However, some investigators report an unclear correlation between Eppendorf measurements and standardized uptake values (SUV). This observation may be explained by the structural complexity of hypoxic tumour tissues. Nevertheless, there is a need of standardized procedures to acquire and quantify \[18F\]-FMISO uptake. Actually the use of this tracer is very limited in clinic and the academic studies have included small populations of patients and suffer of the heterogeneity of technical procedures.

The aim of this study is to determine the optimal acquisition protocol and treatment parameters enable to describe \[18F\]-FMISO uptake in glioblastomas known to be hardly influenced by hypoxia. Then, validate \[18F\]-FMISO-PET as a prognostic maker of recurrence.

We will introduce a pretherapy \[18F\]-FMISO PET-CT in the treatment planning of patients suffering of different newly diagnosed glioblastoma and eligible to a radical treatment with curative intent, consisting of conformational radiotherapy and chemotherapy. \[18F\]-FMISO PET-CT results will not be take into account for the patient management. We will test different acquisition protocols and use a wild panel of quantification parameters issued from published studies and original ones developed by our team enable to describe \[18F\]-FMISO uptake. Patients will be followed clinically and para-clinically during one year after the end of the treatment according to the edited recommendations of each tumour type and grade to analyze outcome (failure is define as persistent disease in the primary site, progression of disease, locoregional relapse after complete response or distant metastasis). Thus we will be able to measure failure free survival and determine overall survival.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00906893,imaging; chemotherapy,Adult,Metastatic,Unclear
NCT01491893,Dose-finding and Safety Study of an Oncolytic Polio/Rhinovirus Recombinant Against Recurrent WHO Grade IV Malignant Glioma,COMPLETED,['PHASE1'],INTERVENTIONAL,61,ACTUAL,"Daniel Landi, MD (Duke University)",4/25/2012,10/1/2021,6/27/2017,"Istari Oncology, Inc.",National Cancer Institute (NCI); Brain Tumor Research Charity Grant; Duke University,GBM; Glioblastoma; Glioma; Malignant Glioma,Recombinant nonpathogenic polio-rhinovirus chimera (PVSRIPO),18 years,,ALL,"Purpose of the Study:

To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of PVSRIPO when delivered intracerebrally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED). To obtain correlative mechanistic evidence of PVSRIPO's effects on infected WHO Grade IV malignant glioma tumors and to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant glioma patients. To obtain information about clinical response rates to intratumoral inoculation of PVSRIPO. To estimate the efficacy of PVSRIPO administered at the optimal dose.","PVSRIPO is a genetically recombinant, non-pathogenic poliovirus:rhinovirus chimera with a tumor-specific conditional replication phenotype. It consists of the genome of the live attenuated poliovirus serotype 1 (SABIN) vaccine (PV1S) with its cognate internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element replaced with that of human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2). PVSRIPO has been manufactured at NCI-Frederick, NCI, NIH.

Catheter Implantation: PVSRIPO will be delivered directly into the tumor. A stereotactic biopsy will be performed prior to virus administration for frozen section confirmation of viable tumor and further analysis. The biopsy needle will be placed with stereotactic guidance by a Cosman-Robert-Wells, MRI-compatible, stereotactic head frame or similar frameless device. Immediately following the stereotactically-guided tumor biopsy, a catheter will be implanted in the operating room (OR) at a site the same or different from that used for the biopsy using sterile techniques. A CT may be used to confirm catheter placement post-operatively.

Agent infusion: The entire volume of the agent to be delivered will be pre-loaded into a syringe by the investigational pharmacist and connected to the catheter under sterile conditions in the Neuro-Surgical Intensive Care Unit (NSICU) or neuro step down unit just prior to the beginning of infusion. Drug infusion will occur in the NSICU or neuro step down unit so that all other emergency facilities will be available. Patients will be infused through a Medfusion 3500 or 3010 infusion pump pre-programmed to a delivery rate of 500 microliters/hour. The total amount of the inoculum delivered to the patient will be 3 ml. The virus injection procedure will be completed within 6.5 hours. The catheter will be removed following the post-PVSRIPO infusion MRI.

Biopsy sampling and analyses: Biopsy material will be obtained from tumor tissue prior to virus administration. This tissue material will be subjected to routine histology to confirm tumor recurrence by the study neuropathologist, Dr. R. McLendon or his designate. Molecular genetic tests will also be conducted on extracts of tumor cells from the protocol-specified biopsy prior to PVSRIPO infusion. After acquiring sufficient tissue for standard clinical pathologic testing, up to three additional core biopsies will be obtained, if possible. The additional core biopsies will be used for genetic analysis, including full genome or full exome sequencing, as well as other molecular genetic testing. This testing will include, but is not limited to, DNA sequencing, gene amplification, and gene expression. Additional pathology tests on the protocol-specified biopsy tissue may be included, if a sufficient amount of tissue remains after standard clinical pathologic testing.

Selected patients who benefited from the initial infusion of PVSRIPO within this protocol will be eligible for a second infusion. All procedures previously described will be followed; however, the addition of a single dose of lomustine 8 weeks after PVSRIPO administration will alter the schedule of events that was previously described.

During the dose escalation phase of the study, the starting amount (dose level 1) of PVSRIPO to be delivered was 1.0 x 10\^8 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50). Dose level 2 was 3.3 x 10\^8 TCID50, dose level 3 was 1.0 x 10\^9 TCID50, dose level 4 was 3.3 x 10\^9 TCID50, and dose level 5 wase 1.0 x 10\^10 TCID50. 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID50) is the unit of measure of infectious virus titer.

To minimize the number of patients treated at low-dose levels during the dose escalation phase, we used a two-step continual reassessment method (CRM) design that included an escalation step and a model-guided step. In the dose escalation phase, dose levels were rapidly escalated as preclinical data suggested that dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) would not occur at any of the five dose levels that were being evaluated. Decisions concerning dose escalation for subsequent patients were based upon the occurrence of DLT during the first 4 weeks after treatment administration. Initially, each patient was observed for ≥ 4 weeks before the next patient was treated. Starting at dose level 1, one patient was to be treated at each higher dose level. If no DLT was observed within 4 weeks of administration, then the next patient was to be treated at the next higher dose. If no DLTs were observed among patients treated on the first four dose levels, subsequent patients were to be treated at dose level 5. The escalation step was to be interrupted if a patient assigned to one of the first 4 dose levels or more than 20% of patients treated at dose level 5 experienced a DLT. In that case, further dose escalation or de-escalation would be guided by the likelihood-based implementation of the CRM, in which the one-parameter hyperbolic tangent model would be used to estimate the probability of DLT at each of the 5 dose levels based upon available data. The highest dose level for which this estimated probability is less than 20% would be identified as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

After completion of the dose escalation phase and determination of the MTD, the study protocol was amended to allow continued patient accrual to a dose expansion phase, in order to aid in the determination of the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), and to garner more information about patient safety. The RP2D of PVSRIPO is the safe, therapeutic dose where patients have not experienced undue side effects from PVSRIPO or from the management of cerebral inflammation secondary to PVSRIPO administration. To address difficulties tapering patients off of steriods, the dose was reduced to dose level 2 (3.3 x 10\^8 TCID50) for the dose expansion phase. After 6 patients were treated at dose level 2 in the dose expansion phase, due to continued difficulties tapering patients off steroids, the protocol was amended to further reduce the dose to dose level -1 (5.0 x 10\^7 TCID50) with the goal of limiting the occurrence of known possible side effects of prolonged steroid use in patients who otherwise benefit from this investigational therapy. After the treatment of 24 patients at dose level -1, despite the fact that these patients were able to remain off significant doses of steroids, the patients benefiting the most from PVSRIPO appeared to be those who had experienced minimal or easily controllable inflammation. Hence, the protocol was amended to reduce the PVSRIPO dose to dose level -2 (1.0 x 10\^7 TCID50) with the goal of limiting the occurrence of undesirable burden from inflammation and its treatment on as many subjects (and caregivers) as possible. Based upon additional animal studies, dose level -2 (1.0 x 10\^7 TCID50) would also be a therapeutic dose. Reduction to dose level -2 was not due to concerns for the safety of the patients on dose level -1, but due to the observation that less inflammatory reaction appeared to be a predictor of better survival and treatment response. After treating 15 patients at dose level -2, based upon pre-clinical and clinical data collected on dose levels -1 and -2, there was no evidence of pre-clinically or clinically important differences between these dose levels. Therefore, the decision was made to treat all future study patients at dose level -1 (5.0 x 10\^7 TCID50).",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01491893,imaging; surgery,Adult,Unclear,Unclear

A new technology, the MR-Linac, combines an MRI scanner and a Linac (radiation delivery machine) into one unit. This allows for ""adaptive"" RT by obtaining an updated MRI scan each day just prior to treatment, adapting the RT plan to take into account any changes in the tumor or the patient's anatomy on that given day.

CMV does not usually cause significant clinical disease but can cause health problems for people with weakened immune systems. Expression of proteins unique to human CMV has been reported within a large proportion of malignant gliomas (MGs), including detection of the human CMV immunodominant protein pp65-LAMP (pp65-lysosomal-associated membrane protein). Human CMV antigens were not detected in surrounding normal brain samples. The presence of highly-immunogenic human CMV antigens within MGs affords a unique opportunity to target these tumors immunologically.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells in the immune system. DCs are activated then migrate to the lymph nodes to interact with T cells and B cells, which initiates the adaptive immune response. This study generates autologous DCs from peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from the subject during leukapheresis. RNA transfection is the method used in this study for loading antigens onto DCs. DCs are pulsed with human CMV pp65-LAMP mRNA.

Tetanus-diphtheria (Td) toxoid is used for active immunization in children and adults against infection with the bacteria Clostridium tetani and Corynebacterium diphtheria. It is thought that Td toxoid induces an inflammatory milieu within the intradermal vaccine site, thereby promoting the migration of injected tumor-specific DCs. Additionally, in the context of vaccinating the host with tumor-derived peptides, conditioning the vaccine site with Td toxoid has demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity with these peptides. Previous trials have suggested that giving the Td prior to immunotherapy may help improve the effectiveness of the DC vaccine by activating the immune response. This study will further examine whether Td helps activate the immune response by comparing subjects who receive Td pre-conditioning to subjects who receive autologous unpulsed DCs as pre-conditioning.

Varlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets CD27, a critical molecule in the activation pathway of lymphocytes. Varlilumab is an agonist anti-CD27 mAb that has been shown to activate human T cells in the context of T cell receptor stimulation. In pre-clinical models, varlilumab has been shown to mediate anti-tumor effects and may be particularly effective in combination with other immunotherapies. Anti-CD27 mAb has emerged as a novel costimulatory immune modulator that depletes TRegs without impairing activated effector T cells to improve antitumor immunity.

Despite advances in surgical techniques and chemotherapy, the median survival time for these patients remains less than 15 months. This highlights the need for more effective treatments and improved prognostic tools. The globally accepted surgical strategy currently consists of achieving the maximum safe resection of the enhancing tumor volume. However, the non-enhancing peritumoral region contains viable cells that cause the inevitable recurrence that these patients face. Clinicians currently lack an imaging tool or modality to differentiate neoplastic infiltration in the peritumoral region from vasogenic edema. In addition, it is not always feasible to include all the T2-FLAIR signal alterations surrounding the enhancing tumor in the surgical planning due to the proximity of eloquent areas and the higher risk of postoperative deficits.

However, the investigators have developed a model to predict regions of recurrence based on machine learning and MRI radiomic features that have been trained and evaluated in a multi-institutional cohort.

The investigators aim to analyze whether an adjusted supramarginal resection guided by these new recurrence probability maps improves survival in selected patients with glioblastoma.","The SupraGlio-AI study aims to test the feasibility of the proposed AI-guided tailored supratotal resection for glioblastomas. The study will provide preliminary data on the accuracy of the AI model in predicting recurrence and the impact of using this information in surgical planning. This information will be crucial in determining the potential for a larger, randomized controlled trial in the future. The pilot study will also allow for refinement of the study design, intervention, and data collection processes before a larger-scale study is conducted. In addition to testing the feasibility and efficacy of the AI-guided tailored supratotal resection, this pilot study also has two secondary objectives: 1) Survival Analysis: A survival analysis will be performed to compare the prospective cohort of patients undergoing the AI-guided procedure with a retrospective cohort of glioblastoma patients who underwent standard gross total resection. The survival analysis will provide insights into the impact of using the AI model on patient outcomes and help determine the potential benefits of this approach. 2) Histopathological and Transcriptomic Analysis: The study will also include a histopathological and transcriptomic analysis of the tissue samples obtained from the high-risk regions defined by the AI model. This analysis will provide information on the molecular and cellular changes occurring in these regions and may offer insights into the underlying biology of glioblastoma recurrence. These data will inform the development of future studies aimed at improving patient outcomes.

By incorporating these secondary objectives, this pilot study will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of using AI in guiding tailored supratotal resection for glioblastomas.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* How does the coverage of the recurrence volume by a radiotherapy plan based on advanced MRI compare to the coverage by the clinical radiotherapy plan?
* How does the distribution of the dose to organs at risk by a radiotherapy plan based on advanced MRI compare to the distribution by the clinical radiotherapy plan?

Participants will undergo an extended MRI-protocol prior to radiotherapy. This extended MRI-protocol includes the clinical brain tumor imaging protocol plus additional advanced MRI-sequences. Radiation treatment and patient follow-up will occur according to the clinical standard.","Rationale: One of the fundamentals of glioblastoma management is radiotherapy, where ionizing radiation is aimed towards a specific target area in the brain to inhibit further tumor growth. As these brain tumors are notorious for their extensive tumor infiltration, where tumor grows beyond the tumor that is visible on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this target area, defined as the clinical target volume (CTV), consists of the visible tumor plus a 1.5-cm isotropic safety margin. In the majority of cases, this unspecific CTV margin adequately covers tumor infiltration, but inevitably also includes considerable amounts of healthy tissue. Radiation-induced side-effects like headaches, nausea, fatigue and cognitive decline can substantially affect the quality of life for these patients. An opportunity arises to indirectly visualize tumor infiltration with state-of-the-art advanced MRI (aMRI) techniques, providing additional information on biology rather than only showing anatomical information through conventional MRI. A workflow has been developed to create a CTV based on these aMRI scans (CTVbio) rather than an isotropic expansion. With the additional information that aMRI provides, it could be possible to more accurately define what needs to be targeted and thus minimize damage to healthy tissue. In this research, the aim is to assess the potential of integrating aMRI into radiotherapy target delineation for patients with a glioblastoma by comparing the pattern of failure (coverage of first tumor recurrence by the radiotherapy plan) and the expected radiation dose to organs at risk between the CTVbio and the 1.5-cm CTV. It is hypothesized that the CTVbio can result in decreased radiation dose to organs at risk, whilst having similar pattern of failure.

Primary objective:

• To demonstrate that the probability for reduced coverage of the recurrence volume by a radiotherapy plan based on a CTVbio, compared to the clinical radiotherapy plan (1.5-cm CTV), is lower than 0.20.

Secondary objectives:

* To illustrate a reduction in dose to organs at risk with a radiotherapy plan based on a conceptual CTVbio compared to the clinical radiotherapy plan (1.5-cm CTV).
* To evaluate the synergistic information that each individual aMRI-scan provides for the identification of tumor infiltration.
* To explore the association between pathophysiological changes on aMRI and future tumor recurrence.

Study design: In this prospective cohort study, the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning of glioblastoma patients will be extended with aMRI techniques that assess altered oxygenation, angiogenesis and increased protein concentration. In clinical practice at the Erasmus MC, not all patients get an MRI-scan prior to radiotherapy. Patients who would not have received an MRI-scan prior to radiotherapy, will get an extra MRI-scan when they participate in this study. Radiation treatment (and patient follow-up) will occur according to the clinical standard, i.e. using the 1.5-cm CTV for radiotherapy planning. The aMRI-scans will be used to create a theoretical CTVbio and corresponding radiotherapy plan. Pattern-of-failure analysis and assessment of dose to organs at risk will be done to compare the radiotherapy plan based on the 1.5-cm CTV with the (theoretical) radiotherapy plan based on the CTVbio. Additionally, various theoretical CTVs based on different combinations of aMRI-scans are generated to explore the added value of the different aMRI techniques. Lastly, the signal intensities on the aMRI-scans at the site of tumor recurrence are compared with contralateral normal-appearing white matter.

Study population: Patients (≥ 18 years), diagnosed with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as confirmed by molecular or immunohistochemistry analysis post resection/biopsy and referred to outpatient clinic of the Department of Radiotherapy to undergo standard treatment with radiotherapy. The inclusion comes to an end when 53 patients have been included.

Intervention: Patients will have an extension to their standard radiotherapy planning MRI-scan taken for regular clinical care (Brain tumor MRI protocol: ± 25 minutes). Patients who would not have received an MRI-scan prior to radiotherapy, will get an extra MRI-scan when they participate in the study. The duration of the extended MRI-scan, which includes the brain tumor MRI protocol, is ± 45 minutes.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Pattern of failure and dose to organs at risk by the radiotherapy plan based on the 1.5-cm CTV and the theoretical plan created with the CTVbio.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: For patients who will already undergo an MRI-scan for radiotherapy, the burden will be an extended MRI-scan (+20 minutes; the total scan time will be 45 minutes instead of 25 minutes). There is no benefit for these patients. For patients who would not have received an MRI-scan prior to radiotherapy, the burden of participation will be an extra MRI-scan (total scan time: 45 minutes) with additional contrast injection. The dosage and administration are similar to the standard Brain tumor MRI protocol, which has often already been acquired before in these patients. The radiation oncologist may decide to use the conventional MRI-scan from this study MRI for target delineation if they believe it has an added value. The use of the conventional MRI-scans is recommended in the ESTRO-EANO guidelines, but is not routinely done for all patients at Erasmus MC. The advanced MRI-scans investigated in this research will not be used by the radiation oncologist",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06183983,imaging; surgery,Adult,Unclear,Post-Surgery

Progression-free survival (PFS) with this treatment is only 6.9 months and relapse is inevitable. At relapse, there is no consensus regarding the optimal therapeutic strategy. The rationale behind the fact that limited chemotherapy agents are available in the treatment of malignant gliomas is related to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which impedes drug entry to the brain. Intraarterial (IA) chemotherapy allows to circumvent this. Using IA delivery of carboplatin, can produce responses in 70% of patients for a median PFS of 5 months. Median survival from study entry was 11 months, whereas the overall survival (OS) 23 months. How can the OS and PFS be improved? By combining chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action.

Study design: In this phase II trial, treatment will be offered at relapse. Surgery will be performed for cytoreduction if it is warranted, followed with a combination IA carboplatin + IA Cealyx (liposomal doxorubicin) or IA carboplatin + IA etoposide phosphate. Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCIC common toxicity criteria. Treatment will consist in either IA carboplatin (400 mg/m\^2) + IA Cealyx (30 mg/m\^2) or IA carboplatin (400 mg/m\^2) + IA etoposide phosphate (400 mg/m\^2) every 4-6 weeks (1 cycle). Up to twelve cycles will be offered.

Outcome measurements: Tumor response will be evaluated using the RANO criteria by magnetic resonance imaging monthly. Primary outcome will PFS and tumor response. Secondary outcome will include median OS, toxicity, quality of life (QOL), neurocognition (NC).

Putting together these data will allow to correlate clinical and radiological response to QOL and NC.","BACKGROUND - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumour in adults. The standard first-line treatment for these tumours features maximized surgery followed by radiation with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) observed in the clinic with this paradigm are only 14.6 and 6, 9 months respectively. One of the challenges in the treatment of this neoplasm stems from the severe tumour heterogeneity which translates into unpredictable treatment response. As a result, newly diagnosed tumours inevitably relapse after the standard first-line treatment, which is called the Stupp protocol which combines radiation therapy and oral temozolomide. When recurrence occurs, if the patient's functional status is adequate, this will mandate other therapeutic strategies. Interestingly, results obtained in most studies in this setting have been so marginal that there is literally no recognized optimal second and third line of treatment. Admittedly, the access to active therapies is greatly limited by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which severely reduces the chemotherapy entry to the CNS.

When one realizes the extensiveness of the vascular network supplying the brain, it appears obvious that a global delivery strategy via this vascular network as a delivery corridor is credible and legitimate. The importance of this vascular system has already been detailed by Bradbury; the author claims that the entire network covers an area of 12 m2/g of cerebral parenchyma. To understand the extensiveness of the cerebral vascularization in a more prosaic way, let us just consider that the brain receives about 20% of the total systemic circulation although it weighs less than 3% of the total body weight.

The access to a patient's cerebral vascular network is technically easy and actually repeatedly performed in the clinic on a regular basis. Via a simple puncture to access the femoral artery, a catheter can be introduced and navigated intraarterially to reach one of the four major cerebral arteries. Once in the target vessel, a therapeutic agent can be administered via the catheter, that is later withdrawn at the conclusion of the procedure. The CIAC allows the construct of a regional chemotherapeutic distribution paradigm within the area irrigated by the targeted vessel.

An increase in the local plasma peak concentration of the drug yields a significantly improved AUC (concentration of drug according to the time) through the first pass effect. This consequently translates in an increased local exposure of the target tissue to the therapeutic agent. Interestingly, as our lab as shown, it is also accompanied by a decreased systemic drug distribution, hence reducing systemic toxicity and potential side effects. Consequently, the therapeutic concentration at the targeted tumour cells is increased by a 3.5 to 5-fold factor. This procedure is performed in the angiographic suite under local anesthesia and typically lasts around 45 minutes.

The IA procedure is a very safe procedure. Indeed, this procedure has been used at our institution for over 15 years using various chemotherapeutic agents and thus have precise statistics on the risks and complications. Indeed, 722 different patients have been treated adding up to 3600 procedures and have compiled the following events. During the MRI that followed the IA infusion, 66 complications were identified (1.84%), 27 of which were associated to symptoms (0.75%). During the infusion, 39 episodes of seizures occurred (1.08%), all of which were successfully controlled with anti-seizure medication. Moreover, a significant reduction in white, red or platelet blood cell count occurred in 52 patients during the treatment phase (7.2%). This study will investigate the efficacy of using combined chemotherapeutic agents described above. Our team currently uses intraarterial (IA) infusion to alleviate the effects of the BBB. This delivery strategy was shown to be well tolerated, triggered very few discomforts and side effects, and significantly improved survival. So much so, that it is nowadays considered a standard of care for relapsing tumours in our institution.

Like cisplatin, carboplatin is a molecule made of a platinum atom surrounded in a plane by two ammonia groups and two other ligands in the cis position. Unlike the chloride atoms found in cisplatin, the ligands in carboplatin are esther functional groups that form a ring structure. As such, carboplatin is more stable, causes less vomiting and is less neurotoxic, less ototoxic and less nephrotoxic. Carboplatin's exact mechanism of action remains unclear. However, it is well known that carboplatin is activated inside the cell into reactive platinum species. These reactive complexes react with DNA bases to create inter- and intrastrand crosslinks which prevent cell division by hindering DNA synthesis.

At our institution, carboplatin is the primary chemotherapeutic agent for IA infusions and yields positive tumour responses in 70% of patients for a median PFS of 5 months. Although interesting, there is obviously room for improvement in the care of these patients. Hence the current proposal.

For patients in which carboplatin fails, other chemotherapeutics are chosen arbitrarily from a list of agents available for IA infusion. As such, our team has successfully treated relapsing GBM patients with IA delivery of methotrexate, melphalan, etoposide phosphate or Caelyx (liposomal doxorubicin). At the heart of the present study, carboplatin, which will be combined with either one of two agents found to be ideally suited in this setting: Caelyx (liposomal doxorubicin) or etoposide phosphate.

Doxorubicin is an anthracycline, an antineoplastic antibiotic developed from Streptomyces peucetius subsp. Cassius. It is a very potent antitumour agent and is considered one of the most active antineoplastic drugs developed to date. Its effect is produced via different mechanisms: DNA binding and cross-linking, interference with DNA strand separation, inhibition of RNA polymerase, inhibition of topoisomerase II, formation of free radicals and membrane peroxidation have all been suggested.

In vitro studies in malignant glial cell lines have demonstrated that doxorubicin induces a halt in cell growth within 24 hours, and results in apoptosis within 48 hours. It has been identified as one of the most potent chemotherapeutic drugs against malignant glioma cell lines in vitro. However, in vivo, the use of doxorubicin is limited by its inability to cross the BBB.

Doxorubicin is rapidly distributed in the body tissues, and binds to plasma protein and cell membranes. The clinical application of this agent is unfortunately limited by its dose-related side effects such as cardiotoxicity and myleotoxicity.

Caelyx is a chlorhydrate of doxorubicin encapsulated within a pegylated liposome. The liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (Caelyx) exhibits an altered pharmacokinetic profile favouring the use of this drug formulation in brain tumour treatment. It has a longer terminal half-life than free doxorubicin, and reaches greater concentration in the tumour. Because of a decreased uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, the drug remains in circulation much longer. This seems to be especially true in glioblastoma, where it tends to accumulate in significant concentration due to the increase in neovascularisation. This has been shown in experimental settings, as well as in the clinic. Interestingly, because of its altered pharmacokinetic properties, it also presents a reduced toxicity profile. The liposomal formulation of doxorubicin causes less myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting and alopecia than standard doxorubicin. The cardiotoxicity is also reduced.

However, even with the greater accumulation of the drug in the tumour cells, its rate of BBB penetration when administered via IV infusion remains a limiting factor. Indeed, it is too low to yield a significant concentration accumulation within the tumour site to produce a therapeutic benefit.

Etoposide phosphate (Etopophos; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) is a water-soluble prodrug of etoposide that is rapidly and completely converted to the parent compound after intravenous dosing. The pharmacokinetic profile of either etoposide or etoposide phosphate is identical. Toxicity and clinical activity are also the same. Since etoposide phosphate is water soluble, solutions of up to 20 mg/mL can be prepared. However, in high doses, it can only be given as a 5-minute bolus, in small volumes and as a continuous infusion. Furthermore, it is not formulated with polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80 (Tween; ICI Americas, Wilmington, DE), and ethanol, and does not cause acidosis when given at high doses. The easier-to-use etoposide phosphate represents an improved formulation of etoposide.

Classically, etoposide must be diluted prior to use with sodium chloride (0.9% w/v) or glucose (5% w/v) solutions to concentration of 0.2 mg/mL (i.e., 1 ml of concentrate in 100 ml of vehicle) up to 0.4 mg/mL (i.e., 2 ml of concentrate in 100 ml of vehicle). Evidently, this cannot be something considered in a setting of IA administration, as the volume administered would be excessive. Hence, the use of etoposide phosphate, for which 100-fold increased concentration can be prepared in a volume accessible for an IA administration: 200 cc.

STUDY DESIGN - This clinical trial will be an open label randomized phase II study in which intraarterial administration of carboplatin (400 mg/m2) combined with Caelyx (30 mg/m2) will be compared with intraarterial administration of carboplatin (400 mg/m2) combined with etoposide phosphate (400 mg/m2). Patients that have failed the standard first line of treatment (Stupp protocol) and that are diagnosed with recurrent GBM will be randomly distributed to one of the two second-line treatment paradigms using the block randomization method. Each recruited patient will undergo maximal resection before beginning treatments. Treatment cycles will be administered on a monthly basis until a progression is identified on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or until a total of 12 cycles have been completed. The cohort will count 120 patients that will be divided into two groups of 60 patients receiving one of the two chemotherapeutic combinations. As to which of the two combinations will be best remains to be determined. For that reason, data from our latest published clinical trial and patients treated with intraarterial carboplatin at our institution will be used as benchmarks for baseline comparisons (OS of 11 months and PFS of 5 months from study entry).

AIM - By using carboplatin in combination with Caelyx or etoposide phosphate in the setting of an IA infusion, our intention is to optimally deliver carboplatin-based chemotherapy combinations to the brain beyond the BBB, and more specifically to the tumour cells.

HYPOTHESES - In patients treated with either combination, our prediction is that this will lead to an improved tumour response and control rate, with minimal impact on the quality of life. Our preliminary clinical data seems to support this hypothesis.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06356883,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Even with best conventional therapy (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy), the most of median survivals are less than 2 years. The one-year progression-free survival (PFS) is less than 20%. Recently, the immune therapy is a new promising therapy for GBM from the evidences of published experimental data and clinical trials.

However, the outcomes of immune therapy are still equivocal. The critical point of immune therapy is strongly influenced by tumor microenvironment. Up to now, for example, immune checkpoint inhibitor such as programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was found to induce exhaustion of CD8 T cell by of PD-1/PD-L1 reaction. Unfortunately, GBM cells always have high PD-L1 expression. It means the higher PD-1 level of T-cell indicates the higher immune suppression by GBM tumor cells.

In the investigators preclinical study, the best murine survival was found to be the combination outcome of dendritic cell (DC) with anti-PD-1 therapy which was better than that of DC therapy only. From previously ADCV-treated patients, the median of PD-1/CD8 was 0.21. When the PD-1/CD8 ratio less than 0.21, this patient is defined as with low PD-1 level.

From the investigators previous experience, patients with low PD-1/CD8 ratio had far better 2-year overall survival (OS) than patients with high PD-1/CD8 ratio in ADCV treatment. On the other hand, it showed that OS and PFS had significant reverse correlation with PD-1 level of Tcell during DC immunotherapy. Considering the needs and benefit of patients, the new autologous dendritic cell vaccine (ADCV01) is proposed to be added on conventional therapy in low PD-1 expressed GBM patients and evaluate its safety and efficacy.

In this study, only newly diagnosed primary GBM (wild-type Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1, IDH-1) patients will be enrolled in this clinical trial. In addition to fulfilling all inclusion criteria without matching any of the exclusion criteria, patients will undergo tumor resection and less than 25% of residual tumor size, followed by being subjected to histological analysis. Examinations of molecular diagnostics including IDH-1 for confirmation of IDH-1 wild-type GBM according to the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, and cut-off criteria for expression levels of PD-1 and CD8 (PD-1/CD8 ratio less than 0.21) will be screened for the eligibility to participate in this study and MGMT status will also be determined.

After tumor resection, all eligible patients will receive standard radiotherapy (RT) plus Temozolomide (Temodal, TMZ), followed by adjuvant treatment of TMZ. Patients assigned to the investigational group will receive ADCV01 administration as an add-on treatment after operation in this study.

This study aims to treat eligible patients with ADCV01 as an add-on immunotherapy along with post-surgery GBM treatment and compare the treatment to the conventional therapy (RT plus standard TMZ chemotherapy) alone on the basis of PFS in an unbalanced allocation (investigational group : control group = 2:1). After tumor resection, patients assigned to the control group will receive RT plus TMZ, followed by the scheduled evaluation visits. For patients assigned to the investigational drug group, a standard of 10 doses of ADCV01 (2±0.5 × 10\^7 cell/dose) in addition to conventional therapy will be administered.

The assessment of tumor response is based on \[Update Response Assessment Criteria for High-Grade Gliomas, Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)\] assessed by the on-site investigator and Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) independently. If needed, the repeat operation for decompressive craniotomy evaluated by the on-site neurosurgeon for relief of increased intracerebral pressure (IICP), or for lifesaving will be allowed in both groups. However, in this study, the reoperation for recurrent tumor will be allowed.

RT will be given if feasible considering the total RT accumulatively given is not enough when tumor recurs (total dose 60 Gy). Gamma knife will not be used for recurrent tumor in this study which is different application from previous research.

Regardless of receiving re-operation or not in both groups, TMZ treatment will be shifted to anti-angiogenic therapy (AVASTIN®) 10 mg/kg/2weeks for 6 doses after patients have recurrence of GBM. Pseudo-progression may lead to either premature termination of therapy or unnecessary debulking surgeries. Therefore, adjuvant TMZ is recommended to be continued for a minimum of 3 cycles (along with ADCV01 treatment in the first 3 months of the adjuvant TMZ period), after which other imaging techniques (e.g., Gdenhancing MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy) should be used to ascertain progression. TMZ is not continuously used whenever recurrence. On this end, the treatment course is complete.

If the recurrent GBM in patients assigned to the investigational group is occurred before completing 10 doses of ADCV01 treatments, the patient will be treated by the remaining ADCV01 and complete the originally scheduled treatment.

In this phase II study, 24 eligible primary GBM patients who are with low PD-1/CD8 ratio will be recruited. There will be 16 patients with combination of ADCV01 and conventional therapy, and 8 patients with conventional therapy only. In this trial, the treatment efficacy of ADCV01 measured by one-year PFS rate will be evaluated at the end of phase II study. Because PFS was surrogate endpoint of overall survival in GBM by literature-based meta-analysis from 91 clinical trials, the 1-year PFS rate will be the primary endpoint of GBM clinical trial.

This study is designed with open-label and randomized parallel group. To date, 34 clinical trials of DC for GBM published up to 2017 in ClinicalTrials.gov, there are 5/34 trials designed by double blinded method and 2/34 trials by single blinded and most of 27/34 trials by open-label (please see ref. ClinicalTrials.gov). The other reason for open-label is that the apheresis for control patients is an invasive procedure. GBM is a not easily curable disease; patients with MGMT methylation have a better survival than with unmethylation. In this trial, MGMT status will be evaluated in all tumor specimens for further subgroup analysis.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04115761,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy; pediatric,Adult,Primary,Post-Surgery

Within this trial, a long peptide vaccine containing a K27M-mutated histone-3 sequence, will be administered subcutaneously in addition to standard radiotherapy and thereafter in combination with the human anti-PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab.

Fifteen patients (pts. 1-15) will receive 11 doses of H3K27M peptide vaccine in total starting with standard radiotherapy (RT) and 14 doses of the human anti-PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab (every three weeks, q3w) starting four weeks after completion of RT. The first 3 vaccines will be given bi-weekly (q2w) in combination with RT. One dose of vaccination will be given at the beginning of recovery (RE) period following RT. Vaccines 5-11 (q6w) will be initiated with Atezolizumab after completion of RE. In a safety lead-in, the first three patients (pts. 1-3) will be enrolled sequentially.

Following the last IMP administration, a safety / immunogenicity follow-up is planned for 24 weeks until end of study (EOS). To be able to assess safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the peptide vaccine in combination with Atezolizumab 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled.

Diffuse gliomas of the thalamus, brain stem, spinal cord or other midline structures represent 3-4% of high-grade glioma and harbor H3.1K27M or H3.3K27M mutations as a characteristic founder mutation in \> 70% of cases. H3K27M-mutant gliomas typically occur in children and adolescents but also in adult patients. After biopsy or resection, the standard of care consists of involved-field radiotherapy. Adding alkylating chemotherapy to radiotherapy does not offer additional benefit in retrospective case series and prospective clinical trials in children with pontine gliomas, probably as hypermethylation of the MGMT promoter in DMG is typically lacking. After radiotherapy gliomas frequently recur with a median 12-month progression-free survival of 20 %. Importantly, at recurrence particularly in the adult patient population, there is frequent distant progression and leptomeningeal dissemination, arguing for the necessity of systemic therapy upfront.

From an immunological point of view H3K27M represents an attractive tumor antigen specifically expressed in tumor but not normal cells. Patients with H3K27M-mutant gliomas may harbor mutation-specific T cells, indicating that H3K27M is specifically presented to and recognized by the immune system in a mutation-specific manner. Vaccination of humanized mice with a long H3K27M vaccine results in an anti-tumor immune response effective in controlling H3K27M-expressing tumors in a preventive and a therapeutic manner without causing toxicity. In addition, eight adult patients with H3.3K27M-mutated gliomas were treated with an H3K27M 27 amino acid long peptide vaccine on a compassionate-use basis. None of the patients treated either with the peptide vaccine alone or in combination with an anti-human PD(L)-1 antibody showed any clinical or laboratory sign of treatment-related toxicity except for grade 1 injection site reactions. Importantly, all patients developed H3K27M-specific T cell responses with one patient of the combination treatment group showing long-term response with no sign of tumor progression for \>24 months after vaccination and one patient experiencing complete response after pseudoprogression (unpublished observations). Based on these observations we hypothesize that checkpoint inhibition targeting PD-L1 is required for optimal amplification of a vaccine-induced H3K27M-specific T cell response.

The aim of this phase I trial is to evaluate the safety and immune response to the H3K27M peptide vaccine in combination with Atezolizumab in patients with H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline gliomas.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04808245,imaging; surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy; pediatric,Adult,Primary,Unclear

Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta,,Glioblastoma,Dendritic Cells Vaccine,18 years,70 years,ALL,"Rationale of the Study: Treatment for GBM currently consists of surgical resection of the tumour mass followed by radio- and chemotherapy ((1)Stupp et al., 2005). Nonetheless overall prognosis still remains bleak, recurrence is universal, and recurrent GBM patients clearly need innovative therapies. Dendritic cells (DC) immunotherapy could represent a well-tolerated, long-term tumour-specific treatment to kill all (residual) tumour cells which infiltrate in the adjacent areas of the brain. Preclinical investigations for the development of therapeutic vaccines against high grade gliomas, based on the use of DC loaded with a mixture of glioma-derived tumor have been carried out in rat as well as in mouse models, showing the capacity to generate a glioma-specific immune response. Mature DC loaded with autologous tumor lysate have been used also for the treatment of patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors; no major adverse events have been registered. Results about the use of immunotherapy for GBM patients are encouraging, but further studies are necessary to find out the most effective and safe combination of immunotherapy with radio- and chemotherapy after exeresis of the tumour mass.

Aim of the study. Primary objective of the study is to evaluate treatment tolerability and to get preliminary information about efficacy. Secondary objective is to evaluate the treatment effect on the immune response. Additional objective is to identify a possible correlation between methylation status of MGMT promoter and tumor response to treatment.

A two-stage Simon design ((2)Simon, 1989) will be considered for the study. Assuming as outcome measure the percentage of PFS12 patients and of clinical interest an increase to 42% (P1) of the historical control rate of 27% (P0) ((1)Stupp et al., 2005), the alternative hypothesis will be rejected at the end of the first stage if the PFS12 rate will be less than 8/24 treated patients (Fisher's exact test). In the second stage patients will be enrolled up to 76 overall. The null hypothesis will be rejected (a=0.05, b=0.2) if at least 27 subjects out of 76 are alive and progression free 12 months after the beginning of the treatment.","Background and significance. The therapeutic program will include radical surgical resection of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy (fractionated local field irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week, Monday through Friday for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) plus temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy). After a 4-week break, up to 6 cycles of maintenance TMZ (mTMZ) will be administered according to the standard 5-day (oral intake) schedule every 28 days. TMZ dose will be 150 mg per square meter for the first cycle and will be increased to 200 mg per square meter beginning with the second cycle, so long as there is no hematologic toxic effect. Immunotherapy will follow radiochemotherapy and will comprise 4 vaccinations every second week (injections I, II, III, IV), 2 further monthly vaccinations (injections V, VI) and a final vaccination (injection VII) 2 months after the sixth one. Injections I, V, VI and VII will contain 10 million tumor lysate-loaded DC, while the others will be of 5 million cells only. In correspondence to the third vaccine injection (week 13), mTMZ will start. On the basis of the patient clinical status, further vaccine boosts will be considered as appropriate addition at the standard vaccination cycle.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04801147,surgery; chemotherapy; immunotherapy,Adult,Unclear,Surgery

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. O6-benzylguanine may help carmustine kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy and carmustine are more effective with or without O6-benzylguanine.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus carmustine with or without O6-benzylguanine in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma.","OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the overall survival, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma treated with radiotherapy and carmustine with or without O6-benzylguanine.
* Compare the frequency and severity of toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.
* Correlate the survival of these patients with the expression of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to age (under 50 vs 50 and over), prior surgery (biopsy only vs resection), and Zubrod performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 days a week over 7 weeks for a total of 34 fractions. Patients also receive chemotherapy comprising O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour followed 6 hours later by carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1 of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients receive carmustine IV as in arm I.

Patients are followed at week 48, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years.

MTAP loss/deletion will be determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The trial will include a dose escalation design to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety and tolerability of BMS-986504 (MRTX1719). The trial will be composed of a Phase 0 component and an Expansion Phase 1 component. Participants with tumors demonstrating a positive PK response in the Phase 0 component of the study will be eligible to enroll into the the Phase 1 component that will include 21-day cycles of therapeutic dosing of BMS-986504.","PHASE 0

Eligible participants will enroll in the Phase 0 study and receive BMS-986504 in three dose escalation cohorts over 6 days prior to surgical resection. The final dose will be administered 3-5 hours before tumor resection on Day 6. Participants without histologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent GBM after the craniotomy will be replaced.

Phase 0 Dose Escalation

An initial cohort of three participants will be enrolled at the starting dose level. If ≤1 of the participants experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) through the end of the Phase 0, the dose is escalated to the next level. Dose escalation continues to the next level if no more than one out of three participants experience a DLT. However, if two or more participants experience DLTs at any dose level, dose escalation stops.

A written report will be submitted to the DSMB Chair (or qualified alternate) describing the time intervals, dose levels, adverse events, safety reports and any DLTs observed after enrollment into each cohort is complete. The DSMB Chair will review the report and provide a written authorization to proceed or will request more information within approximately 2 business days. Approval for the initiation of enrollment must be obtained prior to implementation.

Phase 0 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)

DLTs will be defined as any adverse event that is not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes, t and unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness or concomitant medications from Phase 0 Day 1 through termination from the study or study completion. DLTs will include:

* ≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding
* \> Grade 4 neutropenia for more than 7 days
* Neutropenic fever
* As determined by the investigator, any unacceptable toxicity which may include treatment-related death or grade 4 toxicity
* Any non-hematologic toxicity:

  * Grade ≥ 3 regardless of relatedness to study treatment, duration, or baseline grade;
  * Events that meet Hy's law criteria;
  * Excluding the following:

    * Grade 3 nausea/vomiting or diarrhea for less than 72 hours with adequate antiemetic and other supportive care
    * Grade 3 fatigue for greater than 1 week
    * Grade 3 or higher electrolyte abnormality that lasts up to 72 hours, is not clinically complicated, and resolves spontaneously or responds to conventional medical interventions
* Any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes

Phase 0 PK/PD Assessments Tumor PK and PD analyses will be performed at IVY. To assess the PK and PD endpoints listed, blood, CSF and brain tumor tissue (Gd-enhancing and Gd-non-enhancing tumor tissue will be collected and analyzed separately) will be collected intraoperatively.

Retrospective genomic analysis of tissue from Phase 0 and subsequent resections at recurrence will be performed if positive PK/PD responses are observed.

Participants with tumors demonstrating negative PK will not proceed to the Expansion Phase 1 component but will receive standard of care. Participants will complete the end-of-treatment visit, safety follow-up, and survival monitoring as outlined in the ""All Participants"" section.

PHASE 1

Participants with tumors demonstrating PK response will continue treatment with the same dose that was received in Phase 0 once daily (QD) in a continuous regimen expressed in 3-week (21-day) cycles. Treatment will begin once the participant has recovered from surgery. Participants will receive BMS-986504 until the progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study termination by sponsor. Participants will complete the end-of-treatment visit, safety follow-up, and survival monitoring as outlined in the ""All Participants"" section.

Phase 1 Dose Modifications

Participants who experience a clinically significant Grade 2 toxicity considered related to study treatment, or a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity considered related to study treatment may temporarily suspend study treatment. Depending on the toxicity, study treatment may resume within 28 days after discussion with the Safety Officer.

Dosing of BMS-986504 during Phase 1 can be interrupted for approximately 28 days for medical events that are not associated with toxicity related to study treatment or disease progression.

Criteria for treatment modifications and suggested guidelines for the management of toxicities related to BMS-986504 are summarized in the protocol. These general guidelines may be modified at the discretion of the Investigator based on the best clinical judgement at that time. Any toxicities related to BMS-986504 should be managed according to standard medical practice.

A participant must discontinue study treatment, if, after treatment is resumed at a lower dose, the toxicity recurs with the same or worse severity.

ALL PARTICIPANTS

All participants will return to the clinic for safety monitoring per the schedule of activities following treatment discontinuation and will be contacted approximately every 3 months for up to 12 months for survival data collection. MRI scans and review to monitor progression in guidance with RANO criteria will occur approximately 2-3 month, per standard of care. The start of follow-up for long-term survival begins following completion of the Day 30 safety follow up call.

At treating physician's discretion, longitudinal biomarker analysis through liquid biopsy will be conducted to characterize genomic and/or transcriptomic changes from tumor cells or cell-free DNA collected from CSF at Phase 0, at Expansion Phase, or recurrent craniotomy.

Additional biomarker analysis may be conducted using surgical tissue. If the participant undergoes repeat craniotomy for recurrence or progression of his/her brain tumor, IVY will request samples from the resected tumor, CSF or blood to enable longitudinal sample collection and analysis that will help identify possible resistance mechanisms.

STUDY STOPPING CRITERIA

Study stopping rules are:

* If \< 1 of 3 participant shows positive PK at the highest dose level.
* If ≥ 2 participants have a ≥ 4-week delay to surgery due to BMS-986504 related toxicity at any dose level.
* Any unacceptable toxicity such as Grade 4 toxicity or death not clearly related to underlying disease or extraneous cause

The following options may occur as a result of any of the above:

* Halt participant dosing or study enrollment until the toxicity data can be further studied by the DSMB.
* Amend the protocol to address any of the below:

  * Evaluate additional subjects in a particular dose cohort or in each dose cohort to make the study more sensitive to characterizing adverse events;
  * Implementation of smaller dose increases between dose cohorts;
  * Exclusion of certain participants thought to be more at-risk for a particular adverse event.
* Stop the study.
